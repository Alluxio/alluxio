title: Running Apache Flink on Tachyon
---

This guide describes how to get Tachyon running with [Apache Flink](http://flink.apache.org/), so
that you can easily work with files stored in Tachyon.

# Prerequisites

The prerequisite for this part is that you have
[Java](https://github.com/amplab/tachyon/wiki/Java-setup/). We also assume that you have set up
Tachyon and Flink in accordance to these guides [Local Mode](Running-Tachyon-Locally.html) or
[Cluster Mode](Running-Tachyon-on-a-Cluster.html).

Please find the guides for setting up Flink on the Apache Flink [website](http://flink.apache.org/).

# Configuration

Apache Flink allows to use Tachyon through a generic file system wrapper for Hadoop file systems.
Therefore, the configuration of Tachyon is done mostly in Hadoop configuration files.

#### Set property in `core-site.xml`

If you have a Hadoop setup next to the Flink installation, add the following property to the
`core-site.xml` configuration file:

    <property>
        <name>fs.tachyon.impl</name>
        <value>tachyon.hadoop.TFS</value>
    </property>

In case you don't have a Hadoop setup, you have to create a file called `core-site.xml` with the
following contents:

    <configuration>
        <property>
            <name>fs.tachyon.impl</name>
            <value>tachyon.hadoop.TFS</value>
        </property>
    </configuration>

#### Specify path to `core-site.xml` in `conf/flink-config.yaml`

Next, you have to specify the path to the Hadoop configuration in Flink. Therefore, open the
`conf/flink-config.yaml` file in the Flink root directory and set the `fs.hdfs.hadoopconf`
configuration value to the **directory** containing the `core-site.xml`. For newer Hadoop versions,
the directory usually ends with `etc/hadoop/`.


#### Make `tachyon-{{site.TACHYON_RELEASED_VERSION}}.jar` available to Flink

In the last step, we need to make the Tachyon `jar` file available to Flink, because it contains the
configured `tachyon.hadoop.TFS` class.

There are different ways to achieve that:

- Put the `tachyon-{{site.TACHYON_RELEASED_VERSION}}.jar` file into the `lib/` directory of Flink
(for local and standalone cluster setups)
- Put the `tachyon-{{site.TACHYON_RELEASED_VERSION}}.jar` file into the `ship/` directory for Flink
on YARN.
- Specify the location of the jar file in the `HADOOP_CLASSPATH` environment variable (make sure its
available on all cluster nodes as well). For example like this:

      export HADOOP_CLASSPATH=/pathToTachyon/client/target/tachyon-client-{{site.TACHYON_RELEASED_VERSION}}-jar-with-dependencies.jar

# Using Tachyon with Flink

To use Tachyon with Flink, just specify paths with the `tachyon://` scheme.

If Tachyon is installed locally, a valid path would look like this
`tachyon://localhost:19998/user/hduser/gutenberg`.
