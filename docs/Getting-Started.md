### Setting up Tachyon

Tachyon can be configured in a variety of modes. The simplest setup for new users is to
[run Tachyon locally](Running-Tachyon-Locally.html). To experiment with a cluster setup, see the
[virtual box](Running-Tachyon-on-Virtual-Box.html) or [AWS](Running-Tachyon-on-EC2.html) tutorials.

### Configuring the Under Storage

Tachyon can be seen as a data exchange layer and benefits from having reliable persistent storage
backing it. Depending on the production environment, different under storage will be preferred.
Tachyon can be integrated with any under storage, provided an under storage connector is implemented.
Currently, [Amazon S3](Configuring-Tachyon-with-S3.html),
[HDFS](Configuring-Tachyon-with-HDFS.html), [Swift](Configuring-Tachyon-with-Swift.html), and
[GlusterFS](Configuring-Tachyon-with-GlusterFS.html) are supported.

### Configuring an Application

Tachyon provides a [file system interface](File-System-API.html) to applications to let them
interact with data stored in Tachyon. If you want to directly write an application on top of 
Tachyon, simply add the `tachyon-client` dependency to your program. For example, if the 
application is built using Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.tachyon-project</groupId>
  <artifactId>tachyon-client</artifactId>
  ...
</dependency>
```

A special set of applications leveraging Tachyon are computation frameworks. Transitioning these
frameworks to use Tachyon is almost effortless, especially if the framework is already integrated
with the HDFS FileSystem interface. Since Tachyon also provides an implementation of the
interface, the only modification required is to change the data path scheme from
`hdfs://master-hostname:port` to `tachyon://master-hostname:port`. See the tutorials for
[Apache Spark](Running-Spark-on-Tachyon.html),
[Apache Hadoop MapReduce](Running-Hadoop-MapReduce-on-Tachyon.html), or
[Apache Flink](Running-Flink-on-Tachyon.html) for examples.

### Configuring the System

Tachyon has various knobs to tune the system to perform best for separate use cases. For an
application, Tachyon reads custom configurations from the specified `tachyon-site.properties` file
or from Java options passed through the command line. See
[configuration settings](Configuration-Settings.html) for more information about the specific
adjustable values.

### Additional Features

Beyond providing a data sharing layer powered by fast storage, Tachyon also comes with many useful
features for developers and admins.

* [Command Line Interface](Command-Line-Interface.html) allows users to access and manipulate data
in Tachyon through a light-weight shell provided in the codebase.
* [Metrics Collection](Metrics-System.html) allows admins to easily monitor the state of the system
and discover any bottlenecks or inefficiencies.
* [Web Interface](Web-Interface.html) gives a visually rich representation of the data in Tachyon,
but provides a read-only view.

### Advanced Features

While Tachyon can provide significant performance gains simply through accelerating data
input/output, Tachyon also provides advanced features tailored to specific use cases.

* [Tiered storage](Tiered-Storage-on-Tachyon.html) provides additional resources for Tachyon to
manage (such as SSD or HHD), allowing for data sets that cannot fit into memory to still take 
advantage of the Tachyon architecture.
* [Lineage](Lineage-API.html) provides an alternative to costly disk replication for fault tolerance and
data durability, greatly improving write performance.
* [Mounting and transparenting naming](Mounting-and-Transparent-Naming.html) provides the ability
for users to manage data from existing storage systems and easily handle deployments where not all
systems are Tachyon-aware.
