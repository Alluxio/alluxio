# Knowledge Required (To be added)

## Git

## Java

This roadmap assumes you have the basic knowledge about Java:
* You can read the Alluxio Java source code and get a rough understanding of it.
* If you find some Java code that you are unfamiliar with,
  you can search for materials online to understand those Java codes.

Not need to be a Java expert to become an Alluxio contributor, your Java skills
will improve when you spend time reading the Alluxio source code and contributing to Alluxio.

Note that nobody in the community will or should hand holding you regarding the basic Java knowledge
since there are plenty of materials online to help you to learn Java.

## Maven

## Docker
