# Knowledge Required (To be added)

## Git

## Java

This roadmap assumes you have some basic knowledge about Java:
* You understand Java constructs such as classes, objects, primitives, references, methods, 
inheritance, interfaces, abstract classes, and constructors.
* You can use Java commands, such as the ones listed below:
```
# Gets the version of the current java package 
$ java -version 
# Gets the running Java processes including Alluxio processes
$ jps
# Gets the stacktraces from the running processes
$ jstack -l <pid>
```
* After running a command or unit test, you can follow the code that gets executed while running within the same process. 
Some commands may involve communication across different processes that could be located on a different instance; 
these remote procedure calls or RPCs require a deeper level of understanding that is not expected of most contributors.
* You have a familiar IDE to view Java source code, run tests, and enable debugger if needed.
* You **do not** need to understand all the Java API packages, but know how to search for API descriptions when needed.
* You **do not** need to understand all the Java concepts, but know how to search for materials online to help you understand.

You do not need to be a Java expert to become an Alluxio contributor because your Java skills
will improve when you spend time reading the Alluxio source code and contributing to Alluxio.

You can expect help from the community about Alluxio specific questions, but you should be capable of 
learning about Java on your own since there are lots of online materials.
