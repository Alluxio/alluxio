## Alluxio Storage Overview

TODO(Zac): Add an overview of Alluxio storage here, covering
- relationship and difference between Alluxio storage and under storage.
    * replication: hot data in Alluxio storage can have mulitple copies
    * once data is persisted, data can have zero copy in Alluxio but still available to
   applications.
- the indication to application I/O performance when data is cached in Alluxio storage.

Alluxio manages the local storage, including memory, of Alluxio workers to act as a distributed
buffer cache. This fast data layer between user applications and the various under storages results
in vastly improved I/O performance.

The amount and type of storage for each Alluxio node to manage is determined by user configuration.
Alluxio also supports tiered storage, which makes the system storage media aware, enabling data
storage optimizations similar to L1/L2 cpu caches.


## Configure Alluxio Storage

### Single-Tier Storage

The easiest way to configure Alluxio storage is to use the default single-tier mode.

Note that this doc refers to local storage and terms like `mount` refer to mounting in the local
filesystem, not to be confused with Alluxio's `mount` concept for under storages.

Out-of-the-box Alluxio will provision a ramdisk on every worker and take a percentage of the
system's total memory. This ramdisk will be used as the only storage medium allocated to each
Alluxio worker.

Alluxio storage is configured through Alluxio's configuration in `alluxio-site.properties`. See the
[configuration docs](Configuration-Settings.html) for detailed information.

A common modification to the default is to explicitly set the ramdisk size. For example, to set the
ramdisk size to be 16GB on each worker:

```
alluxio.worker.memory.size=16GB
```

Another common change is to specify multiple storage media, such as ramdisk and SSDs. We will need
to update `alluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.dirs.path` to take specify each storage medium we want
to use as a storage directory. For example, to use the ramdisk (mounted at `/mnt/ramdisk`) and two
SSDs (mounted at `/mnt/ssd1` and `/mnt/ssd2`):

```
alluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.dirs.path=/mnt/ramdisk,/mnt/ssd1,/mnt/ssd2
```

The paths provided should point to paths in the local filesystem mounting the appropriate storage
media. To enable short circuit operations, the permissions of these paths should be permissive for the
client user to read, write and execute on the path. For example, 770 is needed for the client user who is
among the same group of the user that starts the Alluxio service.

After updating the storage media, we need to indicate how much storage is allocated for each storage
directory. For example, if we wanted to use 16 GB on the ramdisk and 100 GB on each SSD:

```
alluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.dirs.quota=16GB,100GB,100GB
```

Note that the ordering of the quotas must match with the ordering of the paths.

There is a subtle difference between `alluxio.worker.memory.size` and
`alluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.dirs.quota` (which defaults to the former). Alluxio will
provision and mount a ramdisk when started with the `Mount` or `SudoMount` options. This ramdisk
will have its size determined by `alluxio.worker.memory.size`, regardless of the value set in
`alluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.dirs.quota`. Similarly, the quota should be set independently
of the memory size if devices other than the default Alluxio provisioned ramdisk are to be used.

### Multiple-Tier Storage

For typical deployments, it is recommended to use a single storage tier with heterogeneous storage
media. However, in certain environments, workloads will benefit from explicit ordering of storage
media based on I/O speed. In this case, tiered storage should be used. When tiered storage is
enabled, the eviction process intelligently accounts for the tier concept. Alluxio assumes that
tiers are ordered from top to bottom based on I/O performance. For example, users often specify the
following tiers:

 * MEM (Memory)
 * SSD (Solid State Drives)
 * HDD (Hard Disk Drives)

#### Writing Data

When a user writes a new block, it is written to the top tier by default. If eviction cannot free up
space in the top tier, the write will fail. If the file size exceeds the size of the top tier, the
write will also fail.

The user can also specify the tier that the data will be written to via
[configuration settings](#configuration-parameters-for-tiered-storage).

Reading data with the ReadType.CACHE or ReadType.CACHE_PROMOTE will also result in the data being
written into Alluxio. In this case, the data is always written to the top tier.

Finally, data in written into Alluxio via the load command. In this case also, the data is always
written to the top tier.

#### Reading Data

Reading a data block with tiered storage is similar to standard Alluxio. If the data is already in
Alluxio, the client will simply read the block from where it is already stored. If Alluxio is
configured with multiple tiers, then the block will not be necessarily read from the top tier, since
it could have been moved to a lower tier transparently.

Reading data with the ReadType.CACHE_PROMOTE will ensure the data is first transferred to the
top tier before it is read from the worker. This can also be used as a data management strategy by
explicitly moving hot data to higher tiers.

#### Configure Tiered Storage

Tiered storage can be enabled in Alluxio using
[configuration parameters](Configuration-Settings.html). To specify additional tiers for Alluxio,
use the following configuration parameters:

```
alluxio.worker.tieredstore.levels
alluxio.worker.tieredstore.level{x}.alias
alluxio.worker.tieredstore.level{x}.dirs.quota
alluxio.worker.tieredstore.level{x}.dirs.path
alluxio.worker.tieredstore.level{x}.watermark.high.ratio
alluxio.worker.tieredstore.level{x}.watermark.low.ratio
```

For example, if you wanted to configure Alluxio to have two tiers -- memory and hard disk drive --
you could use a configuration similar to:

```
# configure 2 tiers in Alluxio
alluxio.worker.tieredstore.levels=2
# the first (top) tier to be a memory tier
alluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.alias=MEM
# defined `/mnt/ramdisk` to be the file path to the first tier
alluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.dirs.path=/mnt/ramdisk
# set the quota for the ramdisk to be `100GB`
alluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.dirs.quota=100GB
# set the ratio of high watermark on top layer to be 90%
alluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.watermark.high.ratio=0.9
# set the ratio of low watermark on top layer to be 70%
alluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.watermark.low.ratio=0.7
# configure the second tier to be a hard disk tier
alluxio.worker.tieredstore.level1.alias=HDD
# configured 3 separate file paths for the second tier
alluxio.worker.tieredstore.level1.dirs.path=/mnt/hdd1,/mnt/hdd2,/mnt/hdd3
# define the quota for each of the 3 file paths of the second tier
alluxio.worker.tieredstore.level1.dirs.quota=2TB,5TB,500GB
# set the ratio of high watermark on the second layer to be 90%
alluxio.worker.tieredstore.level1.watermark.high.ratio=0.9
# set the ratio of low watermark on the second layer to be 70%
alluxio.worker.tieredstore.level1.watermark.low.ratio=0.7
```

There are a few restrictions to defining the tiers. There is no restriction on the number of tiers,
however, a common configuration has 3 tiers - Memory, HDD and SSD. At most 1 tier can refer to a
specific alias. For example, at most 1 tier can have the alias HDD. If you want Alluxio to use
multiple hard drives for the HDD tier, you can configure that by using multiple paths for
`alluxio.worker.tieredstore.level{x}.dirs.path`.

## Evict Stale Data

Because Alluxio storage is designed to be volatile, there must be a mechanism to make space for new
data when Alluxio storage is full. This is termed eviction.

There are two modes of eviction in Alluxio, asynchronous (default) and synchronous. You can switch
between the two by enabling and disabling the space reserver which handles asynchronous eviction.
For example, to turn off asynchronous eviction:

```
alluxio.worker.tieredstore.reserver.enabled=false
```

Asynchronous eviction is the default implementation of eviction. It relies on a periodic space reserver
thread in each worker to evict data. It waits until the worker storage utilization reaches a configurable
 high watermark. Then it evicts data based on the eviction policy until it reaches the configurable low
  watermark. For example, if we had the same 16+100+100=216GB storage configured, we can set eviction to
  kick in at around 200GB and stop at around 160GB:

```
alluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.watermark.high.ratio=0.9 # 216GB * 0.9 ~ 200GB
alluxio.worker.tieredstore.level0.watermark.low.ratio=0.75 # 216GB * 0.75 ~ 160GB
```

In write or read-cache heavy workloads, asynchronous eviction can improve performance.

Synchronous eviction waits for a client to request more space than is currently available on the worker
and then kicks off the eviction process to free up enough space to serve that request. This leads to many
small eviction attempts, which is less efficient but maximizes the utilization of available Alluxio space.
In general, we recommend to use asynchronous eviction.

### Eviction Policies

TODO(Zac): cleanup this section.
We should describe the default behavior, and give use cases for why users would want to use each evictor.
And we mention that users can write their own evictors, but don't give any resources for them to do that.


Alluxio uses evictors for deciding which blocks to evict, when space needs to be
freed. Users can specify the Alluxio evictor to achieve fine grained control over the eviction
process.

Alluxio supports custom evictors. Out-of-the-box implementations include:

* **GreedyEvictor**: Evicts arbitrary blocks until the required size is freed.
* **LRUEvictor**: Evicts the least-recently-used blocks until the required size is freed.
* **LRFUEvictor**: Evicts blocks based on least-recently-used and least-frequently-used with a configurable weight.
    If the weight is completely biased toward least-recently-used, the behavior will be the same as
    the LRUEvictor.
* **PartialLRUEvictor** : Evicts based on least-recently-used but will choose StorageDir with
maximum free space and only evict from that StorageDir.

In the future, additional evictors will be available. Since Alluxio supports custom evictors,
you can also develop your own evictor appropriate for your workload.

When using synchronous eviction, it is recommended to use smaller block sizes (around 64-128MB),
to reduce the latency of block eviction. When using the space reserver, block size does not affect
eviction latency.

## Manage Data in Alluxio

TODO(Zac): Explain Alluxio-specific concepts in storage which is unique to Alluxio.
We want to cover
- "free": remove data from Alluxio space but the same data will still be available in UFS if
persisted
- "load": preload data from UFS to Alluxio
- "persist"
- "ttl": this section is already added.

Note that, since this article is already long, we want to stay in the concept plus possible examples
using Alluxio CLI. Let's not go deep into Java-level examples.

TODO(Zac): Add examples on check capacity, fraction of used capacity and etc


### Set Time to Live (TTL)

TODO(Zac): Clean up this section on setting TTL on data. e.g., we can remove the Java API examples.

Alluxio supports a `Time to Live (TTL)` setting on each file and directory in the namespace. This
feature can be used to effectively manage the Alluxio cache, especially in environments with strict
guarantees on the data access patterns. For example, if analytics is only done on the last week of
ingested data, TTL can be used to explicitly flush old data to free the cache for new
files.

Alluxio has TTL attributes associated with each file or directory. These attributes are journaled
and persist across cluster restarts. The active master node is responsible for holding the metadata
in memory when Alluxio is serving. Internally, the master runs a background thread which
periodically checks if files have reached their TTL.

Note that the background thread runs on a configurable period, by default 1 hour. This means a TTL
will not be enforced until the next check interval, and the enforcement of a TTL can be up to 1
TTL interval late. The interval length is set by the `alluxio.master.ttl.checker.interval`
property.

For example, to set the interval to 10 minutes, add the following to `alluxio-site.properties`:

```
alluxio.master.ttl.checker.interval=10m
```

Refer to the [configuration page](Configuration-Settings.html) for more details on setting Alluxio
configurations.

While the master node enforces TTLs, it is up to the clients to set the appropriate TTLs.

#### APIs

There are three ways to set the TTL of a path.

1. Through the Alluxio shell command line.
1. Through the Alluxio Java File System API.
1. Passively on each load metadata or create file.

The TTL API is as follows:

```
SetTTL(path, duration, action)
`path`          the path in the Alluxio namespace
`duration`      the number of milliseconds before the TTL action goes into effect, this overrides
                any previous value
`action`        the action to take when duration has elapsed. `FREE` will cause the file to be
                evicted from Alluxio storage, regardless of the pin status. `DELETE` will cause the
                file to be deleted from the Alluxio namespace and under store.
                NOTE: `DELETE` is the default for certain commands and will cause the file to be
                permanently removed.
```

##### Command Line Usage

See the detailed [command line documentation](Command-Line-Interface.html#setttl).

#### Java File System API

Use the Alluxio FileSystem object to set the file attribute with the appropriate options.

```java
FileSystem alluxioFs = FileSystem.Factory.get();

AlluxioURI path = new AlluxioURI("alluxio://hostname:port/file/path");
long ttlMs = 86400000L; // 1 day
TtlAction ttlAction = TtlAction.FREE; // Free the file when TTL is hit

SetAttributeOptions options = SetAttributeOptions.defaults().setTtl(ttlMs).setTtlAction(ttlAction);
alluxioFs.setAttribute(path);
```

See the [Javadocs](http://www.alluxio.org/javadoc/{{site.ALLUXIO_MAJOR_VERSION}}/index.html) for
more details.

#### Passively on load metadata or create file

Whenever a new file is added to the Alluxio namespace, the user has the option of passively adding
a TTL to that file. This is useful in cases where files accessed by the user are expected to be
temporarily used. Instead of calling the API many times, it is automatically set on file discovery.

Note: passive TTL is more convenient but also less flexible. The options are client level, so all
TTL requests from the client will have the same action and duration.

Passive TTL works with the following configuration options:

* `alluxio.user.file.load.ttl` - the default duration to give any file newly loaded into Alluxio
from an under store. By default this is no ttl.
* `alluxio.user.file.load.ttl.action` - the default action for any ttl set on a file newly loaded
into Alluxio from an under store. By default this is `DELETE`.
* `alluxio.user.file.create.ttl` - the default duration to give any file newly created in Alluxio.
By default this is no ttl.
* `alluxio.user.file.create.ttl.action` - the default action for any ttl set on a file newly created
in Alluxio. By default this is `DELETE`.

There are two pairs of options, one for `load` and one for `create`. `Load` refers to files which
are discovered by Alluxio from the under store. `Create` refers to new files or directories created
in Alluxio.

Both options are disabled by default and should only be enabled by clients which have strict data
access patterns.

For example, to delete the files created by the `runTests` after 1 minute:

```bash
$ bin/alluxio runTests -Dalluxio.user.file.create.ttl=1m -Dalluxio.user.file.create.ttl
.action=DELETE
```

Note, if you try this example, make sure the `alluxio.master.ttl.checker.interval` is set to a short
duration, ie. 1 minute.
