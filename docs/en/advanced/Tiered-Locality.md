The tiered locality feature enables applications to make intelligent, topology-based decisions
regarding which Alluxio workers to read from and write to.
For an application running on `host1`, reading data from an Alluxio worker on `host1` is more efficient
than reading from a worker on `host2`.
Similarly, reading from a worker on the same rack or in the same data center is faster than reading
from a worker on a different rack or different data center.
Tiered locality allows users to take advantage of various levels of locality by configuring
servers and clients with network topology information.

## Tiered Identity

Each entity is identified with a *Tiered Identity*, where an entity is a master, worker, or client.
This identity is an address tuple in the format **(tierName1=value1, tierName2=value2, ...)**.
Each entry in the tuple is called a *locality tier*.
Alluxio clients will favor interacting with workers that share identical identity entries in the provided order.

Using the template identity of **`(node=node_name, rack=rack_name, datacenter=datacenter_name)`**,
a client with an identity **`(node=A, rack=rack1, datacenter=dc1)`** will prefer to read from a worker at
**`(node=B, rack=rack1, datacenter=dc1)`** over a worker at **`(node=C, rack=rack2, datacenter=dc1)`** because:
- no worker shares the same `node` value as the client
- the first worker shares the same `rack` value, `rack1`, as the client
- the `datacenter` entry is ignored because at least one match was found in the previous locality tier

## Basic Setup

For this example, suppose Alluxio workers are spread across multiple availability zones within EC2.
To configure tiered locality:

1. Write a script named `alluxio-locality.sh`.
   Alluxio uses this script to determine the tiered identity for each entity.
   The output format is a comma-separated list of `tierName=tierValue` pairs.
   ```
   #!/bin/bash

   node=$(hostname)
   # Ask EC2 which availability zone we're in
   availability_zone=$(curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/placement/availability-zone)

   echo "node=${node},availability_zone=${availability_zone}"
   ```

1. Make the script executable with `chmod +x alluxio-locality.sh`.

1. Include the script on the classpath of your applications and Alluxio servers. For servers,
   put the file in the `conf` directory.

1. On the Alluxio master(s), set `alluxio.locality.order=node,availability_zone` to define the order
   of locality tiers.

1. Restart Alluxio servers to pick up the configuration changes.

To verify that the configuration is working, check the master, worker, and application logs.
A log entry should appear of the format:

```
INFO  TieredIdentityFactory - Initialized tiered identity TieredIdentity(node=ip-xx-xx-xx-xx, availability_zone=us-east-1)
```

If the log entry does not appear, try running the locality script directly to check its output and
ensure it is executable by the user that luanched the Alluxio server.

## Advanced

### Custom locality tiers

Alluxio configures two locality tiers by default: `node` and `rack`.
Users may customize the set of locality tiers to take advantage of more advanced topologies.
The list of tiers is determined by the `alluxio.locality.order` property on the master.
The order should go from most to least specific.
For example, to add availability zone locality to a cluster, set:

```
alluxio.locality.order=node,rack,availability_zone
```

If the user does nothing to provide tiered identity info,
each entity will perform a hostname lookup to set its node-level identity info.
If other locality tiers are left unset, they will not be used to inform locality decisions.
To set the value for a locality tier, set the configuration property:

```
alluxio.locality.<tierName>=<tierValue>
```

### Set locality via configuration properties

The `alluxio-locality.sh` script is the preferred way to configure tiered locality
because the same script can be used for Alluxio servers and compute applications.
In situations where users do not have access to application classpaths,
tiered locality can be configured by setting `alluxio.locality.[tiername]`:

```
alluxio.locality.node=node_name
alluxio.locality.rack=rack_name
```

See the [Configuration-Settings]({{ '/en/basic/Configuration-Settings.html' | relativize_url }}) page for the different
for the different ways to set configuration properties.

### Custom locality script name

By default, Alluxio clients and servers search the classpath for a script named `alluxio-locality.sh`.
This name can be overridden by setting:

```
alluxio.locality.script=locality_script_name
```

### Node locality priority order

There exists multiple ways of defining the `node` value for tiered locality.
The order of precedence obtaining this value, from highest priority to lowest priority, is as follows:

1. From `alluxio.locality.node` set in `alluxio-site.properties`
1. From `node=...` in the output of the script, whose name is configured by `alluxio.locality.script`
1. From `alluxio.worker.hostname` on a worker, `alluxio.master.hostname` on a master, or
`alluxio.user.hostname` on a client in their respective `alluxio-site.properties`
1. If none of the above are configured, node locality is determined by hostname lookup

### When exactly is tiered locality used?

1. When clients choose which worker to read through during UFS reads
1. When clients choose which worker to read from when multiple Alluxio workers hold a block
1. If using the `LocalFirstPolicy` or `LocalFirstAvoidEvictionPolicy`, clients use tiered locality
to choose which worker to write to when writing data to Alluxio
