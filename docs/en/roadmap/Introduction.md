# Alluxio Contribution Roadmap (In Progress)

We warmly welcome you to the Alluxio community. We are excited about your contributions and engagement with our project!
This guide aims to give you step-by-step instructions on how to get started becoming a contributor to the Alluxio open source project
and become a qualified independent contributor eventually.

This guide is not a quick start guide but provides a comprehensive roadmap of how to grow from a person beginning with only passion and motivation 
to a qualified independent contributor that can make useful contributions to open source projects like Alluxio.

If you are a student, considering it as an internship with industry training. 
If you are a new grad, considering it as the onboarding guide provided by your company to train you to be an independent contributor. 
If you want to contribute to an open-source project and expand your capability zone, this guide helps you to expose to an industry-level project while learning java, git, distributed system, etc. 
If you are an experienced engineer who wants to understand Alluxio better, this guide helps you to speed up this process with resources that you can pick from. 

If you have any questions or suggestions regarding the contribution roadmap, feel free to share in the [Alluxio Community Slack Channel](https://slackin.alluxio.io).
Many Alluxio experts in the channel may have gone through the same learning process as you are and are willing to answer your questions!

## Motivations Behind the Contribution Roadmap

### By [@LuQQiu](https://github.com/LuQQiu):

Several years back, when I was studying data science during my postgraduate period, names of open source projects flowed into my ears (HDFS, Pig, Spark, etc). 
That’s a world with talented and experienced software engineers. I want to become one of them. 
That's the motivation and passion for me to start working on open-source projects, but it’s extremely hard in the beginning, for a person who only knows a little bit of data structure and algorithm, a little bit of Java, 
to get hands-on industry-level projects and to make real contributions. The gap between school to industry and the gap between my ability to the ability needed for contributing are huge.

Luckily I encountered Alluxio and finished my first step of contributing to an open-source project. 
Compared to other open-source projects, Alluxio has some really easy new contribution tasks for me to start with 
(e.g. [removing a useless test](https://github.com/Alluxio/alluxio/pull/4939), [update one line of the doc](https://github.com/Alluxio/alluxio/pull/4941), 
[fix a wrong variable name](https://github.com/Alluxio/alluxio/pull/5171), [support a different time unit](https://github.com/Alluxio/alluxio/pull/4996)). 
The experienced engineers in Alluxio are helpful and give me useful advice on how to write industry-level code. 
Did I contribute to Alluxio at that time? I felt that they were contributing to me. 
They spent much more time than needed for themselves to make the changes to help me grow.

I went through the first hard step, but the next step was even harder. 
How can I make useful contributions to Alluxio? There were not many tutorials available and I stuck.

Again luckily, this open-source contributing experience helps me win my first job and I encountered several excellent mentors to help me grow into a qualified individual contributor that can make significant contributions to Alluxio!

In the past few years, I met many people like me who have the motivation and passion to contribute to open-source projects. 
They encountered the same pain point as me not knowing how to make the first contribution and how to make useful contributions. 
Not as lucky as me who met good mentors, many of those people try, eventually give up, and leave the open-source communities leaving the open-source communities a playground of companies.

This phenomenon brought me the question: can other people replicate my learning path without multiple excellent mentors spending a large amount of time and resources? 
Yeah! Definitely! Other Alluxio experts and I can write down our learning paths and write down all the useful information we gained from our mentors or our experience into this contribution roadmap which is similar to a textbook. 
Alluxio community slack channel has many Alluxio contributors that can help answer your questions just like your teachers/mentors. 
Other people like the previous me can follow the guide step by step, gain help from the community, and finally make contributions in return to the Alluxio project and the community!
