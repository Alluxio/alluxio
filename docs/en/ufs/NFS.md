This guide describes the instructions to configure [NFS](http://nfs.sourceforge.net) as Alluxio's under
storage system.

## Initial Setup

First, the Alluxio binaries must be on your machine. You can either
[compile Alluxio]({{site.baseurl}}{% link en/contributor/Building-Alluxio-From-Source.md %}), or
[download the binaries locally]({{site.baseurl}}{% link en/deploy/Running-Alluxio-Locally.md %}).

## Configuring Alluxio

You need to configure Alluxio to use under storage systems by modifying
`conf/alluxio-site.properties`. If it does not exist, create the configuration file from the
template.

```bash
$ cp conf/alluxio-site.properties.template conf/alluxio-site.properties
```

Assuming the NFS clients are co-located with Alluxio nodes, all the NFS shares are mounted at
directory `/mnt/nfs`, the following environment variable assignment needs to be added to
`conf/alluxio-site.properties`:

```
alluxio.master.hostname=localhost
alluxio.underfs.address=/mnt/nfs
```

## Running Alluxio with NFS

Simply run the following command to start Alluxio filesystem.

{% include Configuring-Alluxio-with-NFS/start-alluxio.md %}

To verify that Alluxio is running, you can visit
**[http://localhost:19999](http://localhost:19999)**, or see the log in the `logs` folder.

Next, you can run a simple example program:

{% include Configuring-Alluxio-with-NFS/runTests.md %}

After this succeeds, you can visit your NFS volume to verify the files and directories created
by Alluxio exist. For this test, you should see files named like:

{% include Configuring-Alluxio-with-NFS/nfs-file.md %}

You can stop Alluxio any time by running:

{% include Configuring-Alluxio-with-NFS/stop-alluxio.md %}
