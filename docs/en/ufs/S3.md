This guide describes the instructions to configure [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) as Alluxio's
under storage system. Alluxio recognizes the s3a:// scheme and uses the aws-sdk to access S3.

## Initial Setup

The Alluxio binaries must be on your machine. You can either
[compile Alluxio]({{ '/en/contributor/Building-Alluxio-From-Source.html' | relativize_url }}), or
[download the binaries locally]({{ '/en/deploy/Running-Alluxio-Locally.html' | relativize_url }}).

In preparation for using S3 with Alluxio, create a bucket (or use an existing bucket). You
should also note the directory you want to use in that bucket, either by creating a new directory in
the bucket, or using an existing one. For the purposes of this guide, the S3 bucket name is called
`S3_BUCKET`, and the directory in that bucket is called `S3_DIRECTORY`.

## Mounting S3

Alluxio unifies access to different storage systems through the
[unified namespace]({{ '/en/advanced/Namespace-Management.html' | relativize_url }}) feature.
An S3 location can be either mounted at
the root of the Alluxio namespace or at a nested directory.

### Root Mount

Configure Alluxio to use under storage systems by modifying
`conf/alluxio-site.properties`. If it does not exist, create the configuration file from the
template.

```bash
cp conf/alluxio-site.properties.template conf/alluxio-site.properties
```

Configure Alluxio to use S3 as its under storage system by modifying
`conf/alluxio-site.properties`. Specify an **existing** S3
bucket and directory as the under storage system by modifying
`conf/alluxio-site.properties` to include:

```
alluxio.underfs.address=s3a://S3_BUCKET/S3_DIRECTORY
```

Specify the AWS credentials for S3 access.

You can specify credentials in different ways, from highest to lowest priority:

* aws.accessKeyId and aws.secretKey specified as mount options
* aws.accessKeyId and aws.secretKey specified as Java system properties
* aws.accessKeyId and aws.secretKey in `alluxio-site.properties`
* Environment Variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` or `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` (either is acceptable) and
`AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` or `AWS_SECRET_KEY` (either is acceptable) on the Alluxio servers
* Profile file containing credentials at `~/.aws/credentials`
* AWS Instance profile credentials, if you are using an EC2 instance

When using an AWS Instance profile as the credentials provider:
* Create an [IAM Role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html) with access to the mounted bucket
* Create an [Instance profile](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/iam-roles-for-amazon-ec2.html#ec2-instance-profile) as a container for the defined IAM Role
* Launch an EC2 instance using the created profile

Note that the IAM role will need access to both the files in the bucket as well as the bucket itself
in order to determine the bucket's owner. Automatically assigning an owner to the bucket can be
avoided by setting the property `alluxio.underfs.s3a.inherit_acl=false`.

See [Amazon's documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/java-sdk/latest/developer-guide/credentials.html#id6)
for more details.

After these changes, Alluxio should be configured to work with S3 as its under storage system, and
you can try [Running Alluxio Locally with S3](#running-alluxio-locally-with-s3).

### Nested Mount
An S3 location can be mounted at a nested directory in the Alluxio namespace to have unified access
to multiple under storage systems. Alluxio's [Command Line Interface]({{ '/en/basic/Command-Line-Interface.html' | relativize_url }}) can be used for this purpose.

```bash
./bin/alluxio fs mount --option aws.accessKeyId=<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID> --option aws.secretKey=<AWS_SECRET_KEY_ID>\
  /mnt/s3 s3a://<S3_BUCKET>/<S3_DIRECTORY>
```

### Enabling Server Side Encryption

You may encrypt your data stored in S3. The encryption is only valid for data at rest in S3 and will
be transferred in decrypted form when read by clients.

Enable this feature by configuring `conf/alluxio-site.properties`:

```
alluxio.underfs.s3a.server.side.encryption.enabled=true
```

### DNS-Buckets

By default, a request directed at the bucket named "mybucket" will be sent to the host name
"mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com". You can enable DNS-Buckets to use path style data access, for example:
"http://s3.amazonaws.com/mybucket" by setting the following configuration:

```
alluxio.underfs.s3.disable.dns.buckets=true
```

### Accessing S3 through a proxy

To communicate with S3 through a proxy, modify `conf/alluxio-site.properties` to include:

```properties
alluxio.underfs.s3.proxy.host=<PROXY_HOST>
alluxio.underfs.s3.proxy.port=<PROXY_PORT>
```

`<PROXY_HOST>` and `<PROXY_PORT>` should be replaced the host and port for your proxy.

## Configuring Application Dependency

When building your application to use Alluxio, your application should include a client module, the
`alluxio-core-client-fs` module to use the [Alluxio file system interface]({{ '/en/api/FS-API.html' | relativize_url }}) or
the `alluxio-core-client-hdfs` module to use the
[Hadoop file system interface](https://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HCFS). For example, if you
are using [maven](https://maven.apache.org/), you can add the dependency to your application with:

```xml
<!-- Alluxio file system interface -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.alluxio</groupId>
  <artifactId>alluxio-core-client-fs</artifactId>
  <version>{{site.ALLUXIO_RELEASED_VERSION}}</version>
</dependency>
<!-- HDFS file system interface -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.alluxio</groupId>
  <artifactId>alluxio-core-client-hdfs</artifactId>
  <version>{{site.ALLUXIO_RELEASED_VERSION}}</version>
</dependency>
```

Alternatively, you may copy `conf/alluxio-site.properties` (having the properties setting
credentials) to the classpath of your application runtime (e.g., `$SPARK_CLASSPATH` for Spark), or
append the path to this site properties file to the classpath.

### Using a non-Amazon service provider

To use an S3 service provider other than "s3.amazonaws.com", modify `conf/alluxio-site.properties`
to include:

```
alluxio.underfs.s3.endpoint=<S3_ENDPOINT>
```

For these parameters, replace `<S3_ENDPOINT>` with the hostname and port of your S3 service, e.g.,
`http://localhost:9000`. Only use this parameter if you are using a provider other than `s3.amazonaws.com`.

### Using v2 S3 Signatures

Some S3 service providers only support v2 signatures. For these S3 providers, you can enforce using
the v2 signatures by setting the `alluxio.underfs.s3a.signer.algorithm` to `S3SignerType`.

## Running Alluxio Locally with S3

Start up Alluxio locally to see that everything works.

```bash
./bin/alluxio format
./bin/alluxio-start.sh local
```

This should start an Alluxio master and an Alluxio worker. You can see the master UI at
[http://localhost:19999](http://localhost:19999).

Run a simple example program:

```bash
./bin/alluxio runTests
```

Visit your S3 directory `S3_BUCKET/S3_DIRECTORY` to verify the files
and directories created by Alluxio exist. For this test, you should see files named like:

```
S3_BUCKET/S3_DIRECTORY/alluxio/data/default_tests_files/Basic_CACHE_THROUGH
```

To stop Alluxio, you can run:

```bash
./bin/alluxio-stop.sh local
```

## S3 Access Control

If Alluxio security is enabled, Alluxio enforces the access control inherited from underlying object
storage.

The S3 credentials specified in Alluxio config represents a S3 user. S3 service backend checks the
user permission to the bucket and the object for access control. If the given S3 user does not have
the access permissions to the specified bucket, a permission denied error will be thrown. When
Alluxio security is enabled, Alluxio loads the bucket ACL to Alluxio permission on the first time
when the metadata is loaded to Alluxio namespace.

### Mapping from S3 user to Alluxio file owner

By default, Alluxio tries to extract the S3 user display name from the S3 credentials. Optionally,
`alluxio.underfs.s3.owner.id.to.username.mapping` can be used to specify a preset S3 canonical id to
Alluxio username static mapping, in the format "id1=user1;id2=user2".  The AWS S3 canonical ID can
be found at the console `https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#/security_credentials`.
Please expand the "Account Identifiers" tab and refer to "Canonical User ID".

### Mapping from S3 ACL to Alluxio permission

Alluxio checks the S3 bucket read/write ACLs to determine the owner's permissions to a Alluxio
file. For example, if the S3 user has read-only access to the underlying bucket, the mounted
directory and files will be set with 0500 permissions. If the S3 user has full access to the underlying bucket,
the mounted directory and files will be set with 0700 permissions.

### Mount point sharing

If you want to share the S3 mount point with other users in Alluxio namespace, you can enable
`alluxio.underfs.object.store.mount.shared.publicly`.

### Permission change

`chown`, `chgrp`, and `chmod` of Alluxio directories and files do **NOT** propagate to the underlying
S3 buckets nor objects.

## [Experimental] S3A streaming upload

S3 is an object store and because of this feature, the whole file is sent from client to worker,
stored in the local disk temporary directory, and uploaded in the `close()` method by default.

The default upload process is safer but has the following issues:
* Slow upload time. The file has to be sent to Alluxio worker first and then Alluxio worker is
responsible for uploading the file to S3. The two processes are sequential.
* The temporary directory mush have the capacity to store the whole file.
* Slow `close()`. The time of `close()` method is proportional to the file size
and inversely proportional to the bandwidth. That is `O(FILE_SIZE/BANDWITH)`.
Slow `close()` is unexpected and has already been a bottleneck in the Alluxio Fuse integration.
Alluxio Fuse method which calls `close()` is asynchronous and thus if we write a big file through Alluxio Fuse to S3A,
the Fuse write operation will be returned much earlier than the file has been written to S3.

The S3A streaming upload feature addresses the above issues and is based on the
[S3A low-level multipart upload](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/mpListPartsJavaAPI.html).

The S3A streaming upload has the following advantages:
* Shorter upload time. Alluxio worker uploads buffered data while receiving new data.
The total upload time will be at least as fast as the default method.
* Smaller capacity requirement. Our data is buffered and uploaded according to
partitions (`alluxio.underfs.s3a.streaming.upload.partition.size` which is 64MB by default).
When a partition is successfully uploaded, this partition will be deleted.
* Faster `close()`. We begin uploading data when data buffered reaches the partition size instead of uploading
the whole file in `close()`.

### Configuring

To enable S3A streaming upload, you need to modify
`conf/alluxio-site.properties` to include:

```
alluxio.underfs.s3a.streaming.upload.enabled=true
```

### Cleanup

If a S3A streaming upload is interrupted, there may be intermediate partitions uploaded to S3
and S3 will charge for those data.

To reduce the charges, users can modify `conf/alluxio-site.properties` to include:

```
alluxio.underfs.cleanup.enabled=true
```

Intermediate multipart uploads in all non-readonly S3 mount points
older than the clean age (configured by `alluxio.underfs.s3a.intermediate.upload.clean.age`)
will be cleaned when a leading master starts
or a cleanup interval (configured by `alluxio.underfs.cleanup.interval`) is reached.
