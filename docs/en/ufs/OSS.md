title: Aliyun Object Storage Service
---


This guide describes how to configure [Aliyun OSS](https://intl.aliyun.com/product/oss) as Alluxio's under storage system. 
Object Storage Service (OSS) is a massive, secure and highly reliable cloud storage service provided by Aliyun.

## Prerequisites

In preparation for using OSS with Alluxio, follow the [OSS quick start guide](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/31883.htm)
to sign up for OSS and create an OSS bucket.

## Basic Setup

To configure Alluxio to use OSS as under storage, you will need to modify the configuration file 
`conf/alluxio-site.properties`. If the file does not exist, create the configuration file from the template.

```
$ cp conf/alluxio-site.properties.template conf/alluxio-site.properties
```

Edit `conf/alluxio-site.properties` file to set the under storage address to the OSS bucket and 
the OSS directory you want to mount to Alluxio. For example, the under storage address can be `oss://alluxio-bucket/` if
you want to mount the whole bucket to Alluxio, or `oss://alluxio-bucket/alluxio/data` if only the directory `/alluxio/data`
inside the oss bucket `alluxio-bucket` is mapped to Alluxio.

```
alluxio.dora.client.ufs.root=oss://<OSS_BUCKET>/<OSS_DIRECTORY>
``` 

Specify the Aliyun credentials for OSS access. In `conf/alluxio-site.properties`, add:

```
fs.oss.accessKeyId=<OSS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>
fs.oss.accessKeySecret=<OSS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET>
fs.oss.endpoint=<OSS_ENDPOINT>
```

`fs.oss.accessKeyId` and `fs.oss.accessKeySecret` is the [AccessKey](https://www.alibabacloud.com/help/doc-detail/29009.htm) for OSS, 
which are created and managed in [Aliyun AccessKey management console](https://ak-console.aliyun.com).

`fs.oss.endpoint` is the internet endpoint of this bucket, which can be found in the bucket overview page with
values like `oss-us-west-1.aliyuncs.com` and `oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com`. Available endpoints are listed in the 
[OSS Internet Endpoints documentation](https://intl.aliyun.com/help/doc-detail/31837.htm).

## Example: Running Alluxio Locally with OSS

Start the Alluxio servers:

```console
$ ./bin/alluxio format
$ ./bin/alluxio-start.sh local
```

This will start an Alluxio master and an Alluxio worker. You can see the master UI at
[http://localhost:19999](http://localhost:19999).

Run a simple example program:

```console
$ ./bin/alluxio runTests
```

Visit your OSS directory `oss://<OSS_BUCKET>/<OSS_DIRECTORY>` to verify the files
and directories created by Alluxio exist. For this test, you should see files named like
`<OSS_BUCKET>/<OSS_DIRECTORY>/default_tests_files/BasicFile_CACHE_PROMOTE_MUST_CACHE`.

Stop Alluxio by running:

```console
$ ./bin/alluxio-stop.sh local
```

## Advanced Setup

### Nested Mount

An OSS location can be mounted at a nested directory in the Alluxio namespace to have unified
access to multiple under storage systems. Alluxio's
[Mount Command]({{ '/en/operation/User-CLI.html' | relativize_url }}#mount) can be used for this purpose.
For example, the following command mounts a directory inside an OSS bucket into Alluxio directory
`/oss`:

```console
$ ./bin/alluxio fs mount --option fs.oss.accessKeyId=<OSS_ACCESS_KEY_ID> \
  --option fs.oss.accessKeySecret=<OSS_ACCESS_KEY_SECRET> \
  --option fs.oss.endpoint=<OSS_ENDPOINT> \
  /oss oss://<OSS_BUCKET>/<OSS_DIRECTORY>/
```

### [Experimental] OSS multipart upload

The default upload method uploads one file completely from start to end in one go. We use multipart-upload method to upload one file by multiple parts, every part will be uploaded in one thread. It won't generate any temporary files while uploading.

To enable OSS multipart upload, you need to modify `conf/alluxio-site.properties` to include:

```
alluxio.underfs.oss.multipart.upload.enabled=true
```

There are other parameters you can specify in `conf/alluxio-site.properties` to make the process faster and better.

```properties
# Timeout for uploading part when using multipart upload.
alluxio.underfs.object.store.multipart.upload.timeout

# Thread pool size for OSS multipart upload.
alluxio.underfs.oss.multipart.upload.threads

# Multipart upload partition size for OSS. The default partition size is 64MB. 
alluxio.underfs.oss.multipart.upload.partition.size
```
