This guide describes the instructions to configure [Huawei OBS](https://www.huaweicloud.com/product/obs) as Alluxio's
under storage system.

Huawei Object Storage Service (OBS) is a scalable service that provides secure, reliable, and cost-effective cloud storage for massive amounts of data. OBS provides unlimited storage capacity for objects of any format, catering to the needs of common users, websites, enterprises, and developers.

## Prerequisites

In preparation for using OBS with Alluxio, create a new bucket or use an existing bucket. You
should also note the directory you want to use in that bucket, either by creating a new directory in
the bucket, or using an existing one. For the purposes of this guide, the OBS bucket name is called
`OBS_BUCKET`, and the directory in that bucket is called `OBS_DIRECTORY`.

## Basic Setup

Create `conf/alluxio-site.properties` if it does not exist.

```shell
$ cp conf/alluxio-site.properties.template conf/alluxio-site.properties
```

Configure Alluxio to use OBS as its under storage system by modifying `conf/alluxio-site.properties`.
Specify an **existing** OBS bucket and directory as the under storage system by modifying
`conf/alluxio-site.properties` to include:

```properties
alluxio.dora.client.ufs.root=obs://<OBS_BUCKET>/<OBS_DIRECTORY>
```

Note that if you want to mount the whole obs bucket, add a trailing slash after the bucket name
(e.g. `obs://OBS_BUCKET/`).

Specify the OBS credentials for OBS access by setting `fs.obs.accessKey` and `fs.obs.secretKey` in
`alluxio-site.properties`.

```properties
fs.obs.accessKey=<OBS_ACCESS_KEY>
fs.obs.secretKey=<OBS_SECRET_KEY>
```

Specify the OBS region by setting `fs.obs.endpoint` in `alluxio-site.properties` (e.g. obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com).

```properties
fs.obs.endpoint=<OBS_ENDPOINT>
```

After these changes, Alluxio should be configured to work with OBS as its under storage system, and
you can try [Running Alluxio Locally with OBS](#running-alluxio-locally-with-obs).


## Running Alluxio Locally with OBS

Start the Alluxio servers:

```shell
$ ./bin/alluxio format
$ ./bin/alluxio-start.sh local
```

This will start an Alluxio master and an Alluxio worker. You can see the master UI at
[http://localhost:19999](http://localhost:19999).

Run a simple example program:

```shell
$ ./bin/alluxio runTests
```

Before running an example program, please make sure the root mount point
set in the `conf/alluxio-site.properties` is a valid path in the ufs.
Make sure the user running the example program has write permissions to the alluxio file system.

```shell
$ ./bin/alluxio-stop.sh local
```

## Advanced Setup

### [Experimental] OBS multipart upload

The default upload method uploads one file completely from start to end in one go. We use multipart-upload method to upload one file by multiple parts, every part will be uploaded in one thread. It won't generate any temporary files while uploading.

To enable OBS multipart upload, you need to modify `conf/alluxio-site.properties` to include:

```properties
alluxio.underfs.obs.multipart.upload.enabled=true
```

There are other parameters you can specify in `conf/alluxio-site.properties` to make the process faster and better.

```properties
# Timeout for uploading part when using multipart upload.
alluxio.underfs.object.store.multipart.upload.timeout
```
```properties
# Thread pool size for OBS multipart upload.
alluxio.underfs.obs.multipart.upload.threads
```
```properties
# Multipart upload partition size for OBS. The default partition size is 64MB. 
alluxio.underfs.obs.multipart.upload.partition.size
```
