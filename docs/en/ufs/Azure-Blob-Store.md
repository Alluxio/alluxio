This guide describes how to configure Alluxio with [Azure Blob
Store](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/storage/blobs/) as the under storage system.

## Prerequisites

The Alluxio binaries must be on your machine.
You can either [compile the binaries from Alluxio source code]({{ '/en/contributor/Building-Alluxio-From-Source.html' | relativize_url }}),
or [download the precompiled binaries directly]({{ '/en/deploy/Running-Alluxio-Locally.html' | relativize_url }}).

In preparation for using Azure Blob Store with Alluxio, create a new container in your Azure
storage account or use an existing container. You should also note that the directory you want to
use in that container, either by creating a new directory in the container, or using an existing
one. For the purposes of this guide, the Azure storage account name is called `<AZURE_ACCOUNT>`, the
container in that storage account is called `<AZURE_CONTAINER>` and the directory in that container is
called `<AZURE_DIRECTORY>`. For more information about Azure storage account, Please see
[here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-create-storage-account).


## Basic Setup

### Root Mount

To use Azure blob store as the UFS of Alluxio root mount point,
you need to configure Alluxio to use under storage systems by modifying
`conf/alluxio-site.properties`. If it does not exist, create the configuration file from the
template.

```console
$ cp conf/alluxio-site.properties.template conf/alluxio-site.properties
```

Specify the underfs address by modifying `conf/alluxio-site.properties` to include:

```
alluxio.master.mount.table.root.ufs=wasb://<AZURE_CONTAINER>@<AZURE_ACCOUNT>.blob.core.windows.net/<AZURE_DIRECTORY>/
```

Specify credentials for the Azure account of the root mount point by adding the following
properties in `conf/alluxio-site.properties`:

```
alluxio.master.mount.table.root.option.fs.azure.account.key.<AZURE_ACCOUNT>.blob.core.windows.net=<YOUR ACCESS KEY>
```

### Nested Mount
An Azure blob store location can be mounted at a nested directory in the Alluxio namespace to have unified access
to multiple under storage systems. Alluxio's
[Command Line Interface]({{ '/en/basic/Command-Line-Interface.html' | relativize_url }}) can be used for this purpose.

```console
$ ./bin/alluxio fs mount \
  --option fs.azure.account.key.<AZURE_ACCOUNT>.blob.core.windows.net=<AZURE_ACCESS_KEY> \
  /mnt/azure wasb://<AZURE_CONTAINER>@<AZURE_ACCOUNT>.blob.core.windows.net/<AZURE_DIRECTORY>/
```

After these changes, Alluxio should be configured to work with Azure Blob Store as its under storage system, and you can run Alluxio locally with it.

## Running Alluxio Locally with Azure Blob Store

Start up Alluxio locally to see that everything works.

```
./bin/alluxio format
./bin/alluxio-start.sh local
```

This should start an Alluxio master and an Alluxio worker. You can see the master UI at
[http://localhost:19999](http://localhost:19999).

Run a simple example program:

```
./bin/alluxio runTests
```

Visit your container `<AZURE_CONTAINER>` to verify the files and directories created by Alluxio exist. For this test, you should see files named like:

```
<AZURE_CONTAINER>/<AZURE_DIRECTORY>/default_tests_files/BASIC_CACHE_PROMOTE_CACHE_THROUGH
```

To stop Alluxio, you can run:

```
./bin/alluxio-stop.sh local
```
