Alluxio can achieve high throughput writes and reads, without compromising fault-tolerance by using
*Lineage*, where lost output is recovered by re-executing the jobs that created the output.

With lineage, applications write output into memory, and Alluxio periodically checkpoints the output
into the under file system in an asynchronous fashion. In case of failures, Alluxio launches *job
recomputation* to restore the lost files. Lineage assumes that jobs are deterministic so that the
recomputed outputs are identical. If this assumption is not met, it is up to the application to
handle divergent outputs.

# Enable Lineage

By default, lineage is not enabled. It can be enabled by setting the
`alluxio.user.lineage.enabled` property to `true` in the configuration file.

# Lineage API

Alluxio provides a Java like API for managing and accessing lineage information.

### Getting a Lineage Client

To obtain an Alluxio Lineage Client in Java code, use:

{% include Lineage-API/get-lineage-client.md %}

### Creating a Lineage Record

Lineage can be created by calling
`AlluxioLineage#createLineage(List<AlluxioURI>, List<AlluxioURI>, Job)`. A lineage record takes (1)
a list of URIs of the input files, (2) a list of URIs of the output files, and (3) a *job*. A job
is description of a program that can be run by Alluxio to recompute the output files given the input
files. *Note: In the current alpha version, only a built-in `CommandLineJob` is supported, which
simply takes a command String that can be run in a terminal. The user needs to provide the necessary
configurations and execution environments to ensure the command can be executed both at the client
and at Alluxio master (during recomputation).*

For example,
{% include Lineage-API/config-lineage.md %}

The `createLineage` function returns the id of the newly created lineage record. Before creating a
lineage record, make sure that all the input files are either persisted, or specified as an output
file in another lineage record.

### Specifying Operation Options

For all `AlluxioLineage` operations, an additional `options` field may be specified, which allows
users to specify non-default settings for the operation.

### Deleting a Lineage

Lineage records can be deleted by calling `AlluxioLineage#deleteLineage`. The deletion function
takes the lineage id.

{% include Lineage-API/delete-lineage.md %}

By default, the lineage record to delete cannot have output files depended on by other lineages.
Optionally, all the downstream lineages can be deleted altogether by setting the cascade delete
flag. For example:

{% include Lineage-API/delete-cascade.md %}
