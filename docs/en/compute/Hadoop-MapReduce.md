This guide describes how to configure Alluxio with Apache Hadoop MapReduce, so that your
MapReduce programs can read+write data stored in Alluxio.

* Table of Contents
{:toc}

## Prerequisites

* Alluxio has been set up and is running.
* Make sure that the Alluxio client jar is available on each machine.
This Alluxio client jar file can be found at `{{site.ALLUXIO_CLIENT_JAR_PATH}}` in the tarball
downloaded from the Alluxio [download page](https://www.alluxio.io/download).
Alternatively, advanced users can compile the client jar from the source code by following the
[instructions]({{ '/en/contributor/Building-Alluxio-From-Source.html' | relativize_url }}).
* In order to run map-reduce examples, we also recommend downloading the
[`hadoop-mapreduce-examples` jar](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.hadoop/hadoop-mapreduce-examples)
based on your Hadoop version.
For example, if you are using Hadoop 2.7 download this
[examples jar](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.hadoop/hadoop-mapreduce-examples/2.7.7).

## Basic Setup

### Configuring Hadoop Core-site Properties

> **This step is only required for Hadoop 1.x and can be skipped by users of Hadoop 2.x or later**.

Add the following property to the `core-site.xml` of your Hadoop installation:

```xml
<property>
  <name>fs.alluxio.impl</name>
  <value>alluxio.hadoop.FileSystem</value>
  <description>The Alluxio FileSystem</description>
</property>
```

This will allow MapReduce jobs to recognize URIs with Alluxio scheme `alluxio://` in
their input and output files.

### Distributing the Alluxio Client Jar

In order for the MapReduce applications to read and write files in Alluxio, the Alluxio client jar
must be on the JVM classpath of all nodes of the application.

The Alluxio client jar should also be added to the `HADOOP_CLASSPATH` environment variable.
This makes the Alluxio client available to JVMs which are created when running `hadoop jar` command:

```console
$ export HADOOP_CLASSPATH={{site.ALLUXIO_CLIENT_JAR_PATH}}:${HADOOP_CLASSPATH}
```

You can use the `-libjars` command line option when using `hadoop jar ...`,
specifying `{{site.ALLUXIO_CLIENT_JAR_PATH}}` as the argument of `-libjars`.
Hadoop will place the jar in the Hadoop DistributedCache, making it available to all the nodes.
For example, the following command adds the Alluxio client jar to the `-libjars` option:

```console
$ ./bin/hadoop jar share/hadoop/mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-examples-2.7.3.jar wordcount \
  -libjars {{site.ALLUXIO_CLIENT_JAR_PATH}} <INPUT FILES> <OUTPUT DIRECTORY>
```

Alternative configurations are described in the [Advanced Setup](#advanced-setup) section.

## Example

For this example, we will use a pseudo-distributed Hadoop cluster, started by running:

```console
$ cd $HADOOP_HOME
$ ./bin/stop-all.sh
$ ./bin/start-all.sh
```

Depending on the Hadoop version, you may need to replace `./bin` with `./sbin`.

Start Alluxio locally:

```console
$ ./bin/alluxio-start.sh local SudoMount
```

You can add a sample file to Alluxio to run MapReduce wordcount on. From your Alluxio directory:

```console
$ ./bin/alluxio fs mkdir /wordcount
$ ./bin/alluxio fs copyFromLocal LICENSE /wordcount/input.txt
```

This command will copy the `LICENSE` file into the Alluxio namespace with the path
`/wordcount/input.txt`.

Now we can run a MapReduce job (using Hadoop 2.7.3 as example) for wordcount.

```console
$ ./bin/hadoop jar share/hadoop/mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-examples-2.7.3.jar wordcount \
  -libjars {{site.ALLUXIO_CLIENT_JAR_PATH}} \
  alluxio://localhost:19998/wordcount/input.txt \
  alluxio://localhost:19998/wordcount/output
```

After this job completes, the result of the wordcount will be in the `/wordcount/output` directory
in Alluxio.
You can see the resulting files by running:

```console
$ ./bin/alluxio fs ls /wordcount/output
$ ./bin/alluxio fs cat /wordcount/output/part-r-00000
```

> Tipï¼šThe previous wordcount example is also applicable to Alluxio in HA mode. See the instructions on
[Using the HDFS API to connect to Alluxio with high availability]({{ '/en/deploy/Running-Alluxio-On-a-HA-Cluster.html' | relativize_url }}#ha-authority).

## Advanced Setup

### Distributing the Alluxio Client Jar

This guide on
[how to include 3rd party libraries from Cloudera](http://blog.cloudera.com/blog/2011/01/how-to-include-third-party-libraries-in-your-map-reduce-job/)
describes several ways to distribute the jars to nodes in the cluster.
From that guide, the recommended way to distribute the Alluxio client jar is to use the distributed
cache, via the `-libjars` command line option.
Another way to distribute the client jar is to manually distribute it to all the Hadoop nodes.

You could place the client jar `{{site.ALLUXIO_CLIENT_JAR_PATH}}` in the `$HADOOP_HOME/lib`
(it may be `$HADOOP_HOME/share/hadoop/common/lib` for different versions of Hadoop) directory of
every MapReduce node, and then restart Hadoop.
Alternatively, add this jar to `mapreduce.application.classpath` system property for your Hadoop
deployment to the Alluxio client jar is on the classpath.

Note that the jars must be installed again for each new release.
On the other hand, when the jar is already on every node, then the `-libjars` command line option is
not needed.

### Customize Alluxio User Properties for All MapReduce Jobs

Alluxio configuration parameters can be added to the Hadoop `core-site.xml` file to affect all
MapReduce jobs.

For example, when Alluxio is running in HA mode, all MapReduce jobs will need to have the Alluxio
client configured to communicate to the masters in HA mode.
To configure clients to communicate with an Alluxio cluster in HA mode using internal leader
election, the following section would need to be added to your Hadoop installation's `core-site.xml`

```xml
<configuration>
  <property>
    <name>alluxio.master.rpc.addresses</name>
    <value>master_hostname_1:19998,master_hostname_2:19998,master_hostname_3:19998</value>
  </property>
</configuration>
```

See [HA mode client configuration parameters]({{ '/en/deploy/Running-Alluxio-On-a-HA-Cluster.html' | relativize_url }}#specify-alluxio-service-in-configuration-parameters)
for more details.

### Customize Alluxio User Properties for Individual MapReduce Jobs

Hadoop MapReduce users can add `"-Dproperty=value"` after the `hadoop jar` or `yarn jar` command
and the properties will be propagated to all the tasks of this job.
For example, the following MapReduce wordcount job sets write type to `CACHE_THROUGH` when writing
to Alluxio:

```console
$ ./bin/hadoop jar libexec/share/hadoop/mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-examples-2.7.3.jar wordcount \
  -Dalluxio.user.file.writetype.default=CACHE_THROUGH \
  -libjars {{site.ALLUXIO_CLIENT_JAR_PATH}} \
  <INPUT FILES> <OUTPUT DIRECTORY>
```

## Troubleshooting

### Logging Configuration

Logs with Hadoop can be modified in many different ways.
If you wish to directly modify the `log4j.properties` file for Hadoop, then you can add or modify
appenders within `${HADOOP_HOME}/conf/log4j.properties` on each of the nodes in your cluster.

You may also modify the configuration values in
[`mapred-site.xml`](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.7.2/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core/mapred-default.xml)
in your installation.
If you simply wish to modify log levels then your can change `mapreduce.map.log.level` or
`mapreduce.reduce.log.level`.

If you are using YARN then you may also wish to modify some of the `yarn.log.*` properties which
can be found in [`yarn-site.xml`](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.7.6/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-common/yarn-default.xml)

### Q: Why do I see exceptions like "No FileSystem for scheme: alluxio"?

A: This error message is seen when your MapReduce application tries to access
Alluxio as an HDFS-compatible file system, but the `alluxio://` scheme is not recognized by the
application.
Please make sure your Hadoop configuration file `core-site.xml` has the following property:

```xml
<configuration>
  <property>
    <name>fs.alluxio.impl</name>
    <value>alluxio.hadoop.FileSystem</value>
  </property>
</configuration>
```

### Q: Why do I see exceptions like "java.lang.RuntimeException: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: Class alluxio.hadoop.FileSystem not found"?

A: This error message is seen when your MapReduce application tries to access
Alluxio as an HDFS-compatible file system, the `alluxio://` scheme has been
configured correctly but the Alluxio client jar is not found on the classpath of your application.

You can append the client jar to `$HADOOP_CLASSPATH`:

```console
$ export HADOOP_CLASSPATH={{site.ALLUXIO_CLIENT_JAR_PATH}}:${HADOOP_CLASSPATH}
```

If the corresponding classpath has been set but exceptions still exist, users can check
whether the path is valid by:

```console
$ ls {{site.ALLUXIO_CLIENT_JAR_PATH}}
```
