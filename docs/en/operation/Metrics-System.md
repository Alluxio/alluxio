Metrics provide insight into what is going on in the cluster. 
They are an invaluable resource for monitoring and debugging. 
Alluxio has a configurable metrics system based on the [Coda Hale Metrics Library](https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics). 
In the metrics system, sources generate metrics, and sinks consume these metrics. 
The metrics system polls sources periodically and passes metric records to sinks.

Alluxio's metrics are partitioned into different instances corresponding to Alluxio components.
Within each instance, users can configure a set of sinks to which metrics are reported. 
The following instances are currently supported:

* Client: Any process with the Alluxio client library.
* Master: The Alluxio master process.
* Worker: The Alluxio worker process.

A **sink** specifies where metrics are delivered to. 
Each instance can report to zero or more sinks.

* `ConsoleSink`: Outputs metrics values to the console.
* `CsvSink`: Exports metrics data to CSV files at regular intervals.
* `JmxSink`: Registers metrics for viewing in a JMX console.
* `GraphiteSink`: Sends metrics to a Graphite server.
* `MetricsServlet`: Adds a servlet in Web UI to serve metrics data as JSON data.

## Metrics Sink Configuration

The metrics system is configured via a configuration file that Alluxio expects to be present at `$ALLUXIO_HOME/conf/metrics.properties`. 
A custom file location can be specified via the `alluxio.metrics.conf.file` configuration property. 
Alluxio provides a `metrics.properties.template` under the `conf` directory which includes all configurable properties 
and guidance of how to specify each property. 

### Default HTTP JSON Sink

By default, `MetricsServlet` is enabled in Alluxio leading master and workers. 

You can send an HTTP request to `/metrics/json/` of the Alluxio leading master to get a snapshot of all metrics in JSON format. 
Metrics on the Alluxio leading master contains its own instance metrics and a summary of the cluster-wide aggregated metrics.

```console
# Get the metrics in JSON format from Alluxio leading master
$ curl <LEADING_MASTER_HOSTNAME>:<MASTER_WEB_PORT>/metrics/json

# For example, get the metrics from master process running locally with default web port
$ curl 127.0.0.1:19999/metrics/json/
```

Send an HTTP request to `/metrics/json/` of the active Alluxio workers to get per-worker metrics.

```console
# Get the metrics in JSON format from an active Alluxio worker
$ curl <WORKER_HOSTNAME>:<WORKER_WEB_PORT>/metrics/json

# For example, get the metrics from worker process running locally with default web port
$ curl 127.0.0.1:30000/metrics/json/
``` 

### Sample CSV Sink Setup

This section gives an example of writing collected metrics to a CSV file.

First, create the polling directory for `CsvSink` (if it does not already exist):
```console
$ mkdir /tmp/alluxio-metrics
```

In the metrics property file, `$ALLUXIO_HOME/conf/metrics.properties` by default, add the following properties:

```
# Enable CsvSink
sink.csv.class=alluxio.metrics.sink.CsvSink

# Polling period for CsvSink
sink.csv.period=1
sink.csv.unit=seconds

# Polling directory for CsvSink, ensure this directory exists!
sink.csv.directory=/tmp/alluxio-metrics
```

If Alluxio is deployed in a cluster, this file needs to be distributed to all the nodes.

After starting Alluxio, the CSV files containing metrics will be found in the `sink.csv.directory`. 
The filename will correspond with the metric name.

Refer to `metrics.properties.template` for all possible sink specific configurations. 

## Metric Types

Each metric falls into one of the following metric types:

* Gauge: Records a value
* Meter: Measures the rate of events over time (e.g., "requests per second")
* Counter: Measures the number of times an event occurs
* Timer: Measures both the rate that a particular event is called and the distribution of its duration

For more details about the metric types, please refer to [the metrics library documentation](https://metrics.dropwizard.io/3.1.0/getting-started/)

## Alluxio Metrics

There are two types of metrics in Alluxio, cluster-wide aggregated metrics, and per-process detailed metrics.

Cluster metrics are collected by the leading master and displayed in the metrics tab of the web UI. 
These metrics are designed to provide a snapshot of the cluster state and the overall amount of data and metadata served by Alluxio.

Process metrics are collected by each Alluxio process and exposed in a machine-readable format through any configured sinks. 
Process metrics are highly detailed and are intended to be consumed by third-party monitoring tools. 
Users can then view fine-grained dashboards with time-series graphs of each metric, 
such as data transferred or the number of RPC invocations.

Metrics in Alluxio have the following format for master node metrics:

master.[metricName].[tag1].[tag2]...

Metrics in Alluxio have the following format for non-master node metrics:

[processType].[hostName].[metricName].[tag1].[tag2]...

There is generally an Alluxio metric for every RPC invocation, to Alluxio or to the under store.

Tags are additional pieces of metadata for the metric such as user name or under storage location.
Tags can be used to further filter or aggregate on various characteristics.

### Cluster Metrics

Workers and clients send metrics data to the Alluxio master through heartbeats.
The interval is defined by property `alluxio.master.worker.heartbeat.interval` and `alluxio.user.metrics.heartbeat.interval` respectively.

Each client will be assigned an application id. 
All the metrics sent by this client contain the client application id information. 
By default, this will be in the form of 'app-[random number]'. 
This value can be configured through the property `alluxio.user.app.id`, 
so multiple clients can be combined into a logical application.

the timer metrics of each RPC will be recorded as well as the failure counters if any.
