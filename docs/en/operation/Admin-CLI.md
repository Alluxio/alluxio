Alluxio's admin command line interface provides admins with operations to manage the Alluxio filesystem.
You can invoke the following command line utility to get all the subcommands:

```bash
./bin/alluxio fsadmin
Usage: alluxio fsadmin [generic options]
       [backup]
       [doctor]
       [report]
       [ufs --mode <noAccess/readOnly/readWrite> <ufsPath>]
       ...
```

## Operations

### backup

The `backup` command creates a backup of Alluxio metadata.

Back up to the default backup folder (configured by `alluxio.master.backup.directory`)
```
./bin/alluxio fsadmin backup
Successfully backed up journal to hdfs://mycluster/opt/alluxio/backups/alluxio-backup-2018-5-29-1527644810.gz
```
Back up to a specific directory in the under storage.
```
./bin/alluxio fsadmin backup /alluxio/special_backups
Successfully backed up journal to hdfs://mycluster/opt/alluxio/backups/alluxio-backup-2018-5-29-1527644810.gz
```
Back up to a specific directory on the leading master's local filesystem.
```
./bin/alluxio fsadmin backup /opt/alluxio/backups/ --local
Successfully backed up journal to file:///opt/alluxio/backups/alluxio-backup-2018-5-29-1527644810.gz on master Master2
```

### doctor

The `doctor` command shows Alluxio errors and warnings.

```bash
# shows server-side configuration errors and warnings
./bin/alluxio fsadmin doctor configuration
```

### getBlockInfo

The `getBlockInfo` command provides the block information and file path of a block id.
It is primarily intended to assist power users in debugging their system.

```bash
./bin/alluxio fsadmin getBlockInfo <block_id>
```

### report

The `report` command provides Alluxio running cluster information.

If no argument is passed in, `report` will report the leading master, worker number, and capacity information.

```bash
./bin/alluxio fsadmin report
Alluxio cluster summary:
    Master Address: localhost:19998
    Zookeeper Enabled: false
    Live Workers: 1
    Lost Workers: 0
    Total Capacity: 10.45GB
    Used Capacity: 0B
    (only a subset of the results is shown)
```

`report capacity` will report Alluxio cluster capacity information for different subsets of workers:
* `-live` Live workers
* `-lost` Lost workers
* `-workers <worker_names>` Specified workers, host names or ip addresses separated by `,`.

```bash
# Capacity information of all workers
./bin/alluxio fsadmin report capacity
# Capacity information of live workers
./bin/alluxio fsadmin report capacity -live
# Capacity information of specified workers
./bin/alluxio fsadmin report capacity -workers AlluxioWorker1,127.0.0.1
```

`report metrics` will report the metrics information of Alluxio cluster.

```bash
./bin/alluxio fsadmin report metrics
```

`report ufs` will report all the mounted under storage system information of Alluxio cluster.

```bash
./bin/alluxio fsadmin report ufs
Alluxio under storage system information:
hdfs://localhost:9000/ on / (hdfs, capacity=-1B, used=-1B, not read-only, not shared, properties={})
```

### ufs

The `ufs` command provides options to update attributes of a mounted under storage. The option `mode` can be used
to put an under storage in maintenance mode. Certain operations can be restricted at this moment.

For example, an under storage can enter `readOnly` mode to disallow write operations. Alluxio will not attempt any
write operations on the under storage.

```bash
./bin/alluxio fsadmin ufs --mode readOnly hdfs://ns
```

The `fsadmin ufs` subcommand takes a UFS URI as an argument. The argument should be a root
UFS URI like `hdfs://<name-service>/`, and not `hdfs://<name-service>/<folder>`.
