## Highlights

We added a strong `PropertyType` in `PropertyKey` ([4f78836](){:target="_blank"}), which will enforce property key type for all property keys, and validate values when they are set rather than retrieved.  By doing so, weâ€™re able to store values in the expected format which will make the get operations become more efficient.

We added multi-disk support ([31ba1c](){:target="_blank"}) and in-heap cache support ([d102512](){:target="_blank"}) for the local cache.

We also fixed a bunch of flaky tests and improved our documentation and metrics.
