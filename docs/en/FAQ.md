   Alluxio can run with Java 1.8 or above on various distributions of Linux / Mac.

3. Is there an easy way to see the status and health of a cluster?

   Yes, Once Alluxio is installed, the UI is available at `http://master_ip:19999`

4. If I add new nodes to the cluster, will Alluxio re-balance / move the cached blocks to the newly
added nodes in order to balance memory space utilization between the nodes?

   No, Currently re-balancing of data blocks in not available.

5. Is Alluxio master fault tolerant?

   Yes. Please see this [page](Running-Alluxio-on-a-Cluster.html#running-alluxio-with-high-availability).

6. What are under storage systems and how many under storage systems are supported?

   Alluxio uses under storage systems as its persistent storage system. It currently supports [Amazon
   S3](Configuring-Alluxio-with-S3.html), [Swift](Configuring-Alluxio-with-Swift.html), [GCS
   ](Configuring-Alluxio-with-GCS.html), [HDFS](Configuring-Alluxio-with-HDFS.html) and many more.

7. Can I easily add support for other under store systems?

   Yes, in fact support for other under storages is in progress by many contributors. Here is the
   [documentation](DevelopingUFSExtensions.html) for adding other under storage systems.

8. In which language is Alluxio developed?

   Alluxio is primarily developed in Java and exposes Java-like File APIs for other applications to
