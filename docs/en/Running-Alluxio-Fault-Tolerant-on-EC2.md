Alluxio with Fault Tolerance can be deployed on Amazon EC2 using the
[Vagrant scripts](https://github.com/alluxio/alluxio/tree/master/deploy/vagrant) that come with
Alluxio. The scripts let you create, configure, and destroy clusters that come automatically
configured with Apache HDFS.

## Prerequisites

**Install Vagrant and the AWS plugins**

Download [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

Install AWS Vagrant plugin:

{% include Running-Alluxio-Fault-Tolerant-on-EC2/install-aws-vagrant-plugin.md %}

**Clone Alluxio**

[Clone the Alluxio Repository](https://github.com/Alluxio/alluxio) to your local machine.

**Install python library dependencies**

Install [python>=2.7](https://www.python.org/), not python3.

Under `deploy/vagrant` directory in your home directory, run:

{% include Running-Alluxio-Fault-Tolerant-on-EC2/install-vagrant.md %}

Alternatively, you can manually install [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/), and then
in `deploy/vagrant` run:

{% include Running-Alluxio-Fault-Tolerant-on-EC2/install-pip.md %}


## Launch a Cluster

To run an Alluxio cluster on EC2, first sign up for an Amazon EC2 account
on the [Amazon Web Services site](http://aws.amazon.com/).

Then create [access keys](https://aws.amazon.com/developers/access-keys/)
and set shell environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` by:

{% include Running-Alluxio-Fault-Tolerant-on-EC2/access-keys.md %}

Next generate your EC2
[Key Pairs](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html). Make sure to set
the permissions of your private key file that only you can read it:

{% include Running-Alluxio-Fault-Tolerant-on-EC2/generate-key-pairs.md %}

Copy `deploy/vagrant/conf/ec2.yml.template` to `deploy/vagrant/conf/ec2.yml` by:

{% include Running-Alluxio-Fault-Tolerant-on-EC2/copy-ec2-yml.md %}

In the configuration file `deploy/vagrant/conf/ec2.yml`, set the value of `Keypair` to your keypair
name and `Key_Path` to the path to the pem key.

In the configuration file `deploy/vagrant/conf/ufs.yml`, either set the value of `Type` to `hadoop2` or
specify an S3 bucket for the `Bucket` field.

In the configuration file `deploy/vagrant/conf/alluxio.yml`, set the value of `Masters` to the
number of AlluxioMasters you want. In fault tolerant mode, value of `Masters` should be larger than
1.

By default, the Vagrant script creates a
[Security Group](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-network-security.html)
named *alluxio-vagrant-test* at
[Region(**us-east-1**) and Availability Zone(**us-east-1b**)](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html).
The security group will be set up automatically in the region with all inbound/outbound network
traffic opened. You can change the *security group*, *region* and *availability zone* in `ec2.yml`.

Now you can launch the Alluxio cluster with Hadoop2.4.1 as under filesystem in us-east-1b by running
the script under `deploy/vagrant`:

{% include Running-Alluxio-Fault-Tolerant-on-EC2/launch-cluster.md %}

Note that the `<number of machines>` above should be larger than or equal to `Masters` set in
`deploy/vagrant/conf/alluxio.yml`.

Each node of the cluster has an Alluxio worker and each master node has an Alluxio master. The leader
is in one of the master nodes.

## Access the cluster

**Access through Web UI**

After command `./create <number of machines> aws` succeeds, you can see three green lines like below
shown at the end of the shell output:

{% include Running-Alluxio-Fault-Tolerant-on-EC2/shell-output.md %}

The first line shows public IP for current leader of all Alluxio masters.

The second line shows public IP for master of other softwares like Hadoop.

Default port for Alluxio Web UI is **19999**.

Default port for Hadoop Web UI is **50070**.

Visit `http://{MASTER_IP}:{PORT}` in the browser to access the Web UIs.

You can also monitor the instances state through
[AWS web console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-east-1).

**Access with ssh**

The nodes created are placed in one of two categories.

One category contains `AlluxioMaster`, `AlluxioMaster2` and so on, representing all Alluxio masters;
one of them is the leader, and the others are standbys. `AlluxioMaster` is also the master for other
software, like Hadoop. Each node also runs workers for Alluxio and other software like Hadoop.

Another group contains `AlluxioWorker1`, `AlluxioWorker2` and so on. Each node runs workers
for Alluxio and other software like Hadoop.

To ssh into a node, run:

{% include Running-Alluxio-Fault-Tolerant-on-EC2/ssh.md %}

For example, you can ssh into `AlluxioMaster` with:

{% include Running-Alluxio-Fault-Tolerant-on-EC2/ssh-AlluxioMaster.md %}

All software is installed under the root directory, e.g. Alluxio is installed in `/alluxio`,
Hadoop is installed in `/hadoop`, and Zookeeper is installed in `/zookeeper`.

On the leader master node, you can run tests against Alluxio to check its health:

{% include Running-Alluxio-Fault-Tolerant-on-EC2/runTests.md %}

After the tests finish, visit Alluxio web UI at `http://{MASTER_IP}:19999` again. Click
`Browse` in the navigation bar, and you should see the files written to Alluxio by the
above tests.

You can ssh into the current Alluxio master leader, and find process ID of the AlluxioMaster
process with:

{% include Running-Alluxio-Fault-Tolerant-on-EC2/jps.md %}

Then kill the leader with:

{% include Running-Alluxio-Fault-Tolerant-on-EC2/kill-leader.md %}

Then you can ssh into `AlluxioMaster` where [zookeeper](http://zookeeper.apache.org/) is
running to find out the new leader, and run the zookeeper client via:

{% include Running-Alluxio-Fault-Tolerant-on-EC2/zookeeper-client.md %}

In the zookeeper client shell, you can see the leader with the command:

{% include Running-Alluxio-Fault-Tolerant-on-EC2/see-leader.md %}

The output of the command should show the new leader. You may need to wait for a moment for the
new leader to be elected. You can query the public IP for the new leader based on its name in
[AWS web console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-east-1).

Visit Alluxio web UI at `http://{NEW_LEADER_MASTER_IP}:19999`. Click `Browse` in the
navigation bar, and you should see all files are still there.

From a node in the cluster, you can ssh to other nodes in the cluster without password with:

{% include Running-Alluxio-Fault-Tolerant-on-EC2/ssh-other-node.md %}

## Destroy the cluster

Under `deploy/vagrant` directory, you can run

{% include Running-Alluxio-Fault-Tolerant-on-EC2/destroy.md %}

to destroy the cluster that you created. Only one cluster can be created at a time. After the
command succeeds, the EC2 instances are terminated.
