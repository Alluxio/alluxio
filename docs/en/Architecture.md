## Where Alluxio Fits

Alluxio holds a unique place in the big data ecosystem, residing between storage systems such
as Amazon S3, Apache HDFS or OpenStack Swift and computation frameworks and applications such
as Apache Spark or Hadoop MapReduce and provides the central point of access with a memory
centric design. For user applications and computation frameworks, Alluxio is the layer
that manages data access and provides fast storage, facilitating data sharing and locality
between jobs, regardless of whether they are running on the same computation engine. As a
result, Alluxio can bring an order of magnitude speed up for those big data applications while
providing a common interface of data access. For under storage systems, Alluxio connects the
gap between big data applications and traditional storage systems, and expands the set of
workloads available to utilize the data. Since Alluxio hides the integration of under storage
systems to applications, any under storage can back all the applications and frameworks running
on top of Alluxio. Coupled with the potential to mount multiple under storage systems, Alluxio
can serve as a unifying layer for any number of varied data sources.

## Alluxio Components

Alluxio's design uses a single primary master and multiple workers. At a very high level, Alluxio
can be divided into three components, the [master](#master), [workers](#worker), and
[clients](#client). The master and workers together make up the Alluxio servers, which are the
components a system admin would maintain and manage. The Alluxio clients reside within the
applications, such as Spark or MapReduce jobs, or Alluxio command-line users. Users of Alluxio
will typically only need to interact with the client portion of Alluxio.

### Master

Alluxio masters can be deployed as a primary master or a secondary master.
#### Primary Master
The primary master is primarily responsible for managing the global metadata of the system,
for example, the file system tree. Clients may interact with the primary master to read or
modify this metadata. In addition, all workers periodically heartbeat to the primary master to
maintain their participation in the cluster. The primary master does not initiate communication
with other components; it only interacts with other components by responding to requests. There
is one and only one primary master in an Alluxio cluster.

#### Secondary Master
The secondary master replays journals written by the primary master and periodically writes
checkpoints. It does not process any requests from any Alluxo components.

#### Master Deployment
Alluxio may be deployed in one of two master modes, [simple mode](Running-Alluxio-Locally.html) or
[high availablity mode](Running-Alluxio-Fault-Tolerant.html). There must be one and only one
primary master in both of the simple mode and the high availability mode. The simple mode can at
most have one secondary master which cannot be promoted to the primary master. The high
availability mode can have zero or more secondary masters, one of which will be promoted to the
primary master if the primary master fails.

### Worker

Alluxio workers are responsible for [managing local storage resources](Alluxio-Storage.html)
allocated to Alluxio. These resources could be local memory, SSD, or hard disk and are user
configurable. Alluxio workers store data as blocks and serve requests from clients to read
or write data by reading or creating new blocks. However, the worker is only responsible for the
data in these blocks; the actual mapping from file to blocks is only stored in the master.

### Client

The Alluxio client provides users a gateway to interact with the Alluxio servers. It exposes
a [file system API](Clients-Alluxio-Java.html). It initiates communication with master to carry out
metadata operations and with workers to read and write data that exist in Alluxio. Data that
exists in the under storage but is not available in Alluxio is accessed directly through an
under storage client.
