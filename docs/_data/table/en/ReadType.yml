CACHE_PROMOTE:
  Data is moved to the highest tier in the worker where the data was read. If the data was not
  in the Alluxio storage of the local worker, a replica will be added to the local Alluxio worker
  for each completely read data block. This is the default read type.
CACHE:
  If the data was not in the Alluxio storage of the local worker, a replica will be added to the
  local Alluxio worker. If `alluxio.user.file.cache.partially.read.block` is set to true, the
  entire block will be cached by Alluxio space even if the client only reads a part of this block.
  Otherwise, a block will be cached only if it is fully read.
NO_CACHE:
  No replicas will be created.
