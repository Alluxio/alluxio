CACHE_PROMOTE:
  Data is moved to the highest tier in the worker where the data was read. If the data was not
  in the Alluxio storage of the local worker, a replica will be added to the local Alluxio worker.
  If there is no local Alluxio worker, a replica will be added to a remote Alluxio worker if the
  data was fetched from the under storage system.
CACHE:
  If the data was not in the Alluxio storage of the local worker, a replica will be added to the
  local Alluxio worker. If there is no local Alluxio worker, a replica will be added to a remote
  Alluxio worker if the data was fetched from the under storage system.
NO_CACHE:
  Data is read without storing a replica in Alluxio. Note that a replica may already exist in
  Alluxio.
