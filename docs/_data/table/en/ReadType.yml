CACHE_PROMOTE:
  Data is moved to the highest tier in the worker where the data was read. If the data was not
  in the Alluxio storage of the local worker, a replica will be added to the local Alluxio worker.
  If `alluxio.user.file.cache.partially.read.block` is set to true, the entire block will be cached
  by Alluxio space even if the client only reads a part of this block. Otherwise, a block will be
  cached only if it is fully read.
