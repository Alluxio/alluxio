  command will fail if any of the given paths already exist.
mount:
  Mount the underlying file system path "uri" into the Alluxio namespace as "path". The "path"

  directory, it recursively unpins all files contained and any new files created within this
  directory.
unsetTtl:
  Remove the TTL (time to live) setting from a file.
