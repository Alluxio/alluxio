getfacl:
  Get the Access Control List of a file or directory.

loadMetadata:
  The loadMetadata command is deprecated since Alluxio version 1.1. Please use "alluxio fs ls &lt;path&gt;" command instead.

  command will fail if any of the given paths already exist.
mount:
  Mount the underlying file system path "uri" into the Alluxio namespace as "path". The "path"
  is assumed not to exist and is created by the operation. No data or metadata is loaded from
  under storage into Alluxio. After a path is mounted, operations on objects under the mounted
  path are mirror to the mounted under storage.

  objects under "path" are removed from Alluxio, but they still exist in the previously mounted
  under storage.

  directory, it recursively unpins all files contained and any new files created within this
  directory.
unsetTtl:
  Remove the TTL (time to live) setting from a file.
