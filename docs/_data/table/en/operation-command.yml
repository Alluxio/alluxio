free:
  Free a file or all files under a directory from Alluxio. If the file/directory is also
  in under storage, it will still be available there.
getCapacityBytes:
  Get the capacity of the AlluxioFS.
getUsedBytes:
  Get number of bytes used in the AlluxioFS.
leader:
  Prints the current Alluxio leader master host name.
load:
  Load the data of a file or a directory from under storage into Alluxio.
loadMetadata:
  The loadMetadata command is deprecated since Alluxio version 1.1. Please use "alluxio fs ls &lt;path&gt;" command instead.

mkdir:
  Create directory(ies) under the given paths, along with any necessary parent directories. Multiple paths separated by spaces or tabs. This
  command will fail if any of the given paths already exist.
mount:
  Mount the underlying file system path "uri" into the Alluxio namespace as "path". The "path"
  is assumed not to exist and is created by the operation. No data or metadata is loaded from
  under storage into Alluxio. After a path is mounted, operations on objects under the mounted
  path are mirror to the mounted under storage.
mv:

  will fail if "destination" already exists.
persist:
  Persist files or directories currently stored only in Alluxio to the underlying file system.

tail:
  Print the last 1KB of the specified file to the console.
touch:
  Create a 0-byte file at the specified location.
unmount:

  objects under "path" are removed from Alluxio, but they still exist in the previously mounted
  under storage.
unpin:
  Unpin the given file to allow Alluxio to evict this file again. If the given path is a
  directory, it recursively unpins all files contained and any new files created within this
  directory.
unsetTtl:
  Remove the TTL (time to live) setting from a file.
