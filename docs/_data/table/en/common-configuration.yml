alluxio.debug:
  Set to true to enable debug mode which has additional logging and info in the Web UI.
alluxio.home:
  Alluxio installation directory.
alluxio.logs.dir:
  The path to store log files.
alluxio.keyvalue.enabled:
  Whether the key-value service is enabled.
alluxio.keyvalue.partition.size.bytes.max:

  in the `conf` directory.
alluxio.network.host.resolution.&#8203;timeout.ms:
  During startup of the Master and Worker processes Alluxio needs to ensure that they are
  listening on externally resolvable and reachable host names.  To do this, Alluxio will
  automatically attempt to select an appropriate host name if one was not explicitly specified.
  This represents the maximum amount of time spent waiting to determine if a candidate host name
  is resolvable over the network.
alluxio.network.thrift.frame.&#8203;size.bytes.max:
  (Experimental) The largest allowable frame size used for Thrift RPC communication.

  Flag used only during tests to allow special behavior.
alluxio.underfs.address:
  Alluxio directory in the under file system.
alluxio.underfs.gcs.owner.id.to.username.mapping:
  Optionally, specify a preset gcs owner id to Alluxio username static mapping in the
  format "id1=user1;id2=user2". The Google Cloud Storage IDs can be found at the console address
  https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/settings . Please use the "Owners" one.
alluxio.underfs.glusterfs.impl:
  Glusterfs hook with hadoop.
alluxio.underfs.glusterfs.mapred.&#8203;system.dir:
  Optionally, specify subdirectory under GlusterFS for intermediary MapReduce data.
alluxio.underfs.hdfs.configuration:
  Location of the hdfs configuration file.
alluxio.underfs.hdfs.impl:
  The implementation class of the HDFS as the under storage system.
alluxio.underfs.hdfs.prefixes:
  Optionally, specify which prefixes should run through the Apache Hadoop implementation of
  UnderFileSystem. The delimiter is any whitespace and/or ','.
alluxio.underfs.listing.length:
  The maximum number of directory entries to list in a single query to under file system. If the
  total number of entries is greater than the specified length, multiple queries will be issued.
alluxio.underfs.object.store.mount.shared.publicly:
  Whether or not to share object storage under storage system mounted point with all Alluxio users.
  Note that this configuration has no effect on HDFS nor local UFS. The default value is false.
alluxio.underfs.s3.owner.id.to.username.mapping:
  Optionally, specify a preset s3 canonical id to Alluxio username static mapping, in the
  format "id1=user1;id2=user2". The AWS S3 canonical ID can be found at the console address
  https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#security_credential . Please expand the
  "Account Identifiers" tab and refer to "Canonical User ID".
alluxio.underfs.s3.endpoint:
  Optinally, to reduce data latency or visit resources which are sepreted in defferent AWS regions, specify a regional endpoint to make aws requests.
  An endpoint is a URL that is the entry point for a web service. For example,
  s3.cn-north-1.amazonaws.com.cn is an entry point for the Amazon S3 service in beijing region.
alluxio.underfs.s3.proxy.host:
  Optionally, specify a proxy host for communicating with S3.
alluxio.underfs.s3.proxy.https.only:
  If using a proxy to communicate with S3, determine whether to talk to the proxy using https.
alluxio.underfs.s3.proxy.port:
  Optionally, specify a proxy port for communicating with S3.
alluxio.underfs.s3.threads.max:
  The maximum number of threads to use for communicating with S3. Includes both threads for data
  upload and metadata operations. This number should be at least as large as the max admin threads
  plus max upload threads. The default is 22 which is the sum of the default admin and upload
  thread pool sizes.
alluxio.underfs.s3.admin.threads.max:
  The maximum number of threads to use for metadata operations when communicating with S3. These
  operations may be fairly concurrent and frequent but should not take much time to process.
  The default is 20.
alluxio.underfs.s3.upload.threads.max:
  The maximum number of threads to use for uploading data to S3 for multipart uploads. These
  operations can be fairly expensive, however having too many threads may cause bandwidth starvation
  for some threads causing errors. The default value is 2.
alluxio.underfs.s3a.consistency.timeout.ms:
  The duration to wait for metadata consistency from the under storage. This is only used by
  internal Alluxio operations which should be successful, but may appear unsuccessful due to
  eventual consistency. The default value is 60000 milliseconds (1 minute).
alluxio.underfs.s3a.direct.writes.enabled:
  Whether to directly commit files to S3 instead of first uploading a temporary file and then
  renaming the file to the final path name. Enabling this option will increase the write performance
  to S3. Because S3 provides a PUT API with checksum validation, data corruption is prevented. If
  your application relies on the underlying behavior of writing a temporary file before committing,
  you can revert to the old behavior by turning this option off. The default value is true.
alluxio.underfs.s3a.secure.http.enabled:
  Whether or not to use HTTPS protocol when communicating with s3. The default value is false.
alluxio.underfs.s3a.server.side.encryption.enabled:
  Whether or not to encrypt data stored in s3. The default value is false.
alluxio.underfs.s3a.socket.timeout.ms:
  Length of the socket timeout when communicating with s3. The default value is 50000.
alluxio.web.resources:
  Path to the web application resources.
alluxio.web.threads:
  How many threads to use for the web server.
alluxio.work.directory:
  The directory to use for Alluxio's working directory. By default, the journal, logs,
  and under file system data (if using local filesystem) are written here.
alluxio.zookeeper.address:
  Address of ZooKeeper
alluxio.zookeeper.election.path:
  Election directory in ZooKeeper.
alluxio.zookeeper.enabled:
  If true, setup master fault tolerant mode using ZooKeeper.
alluxio.zookeeper.leader.path:
  Leader directory in ZooKeeper.
alluxio.zookeeper.leader.inquiry.retry:
  The number of retries to inquire leader from ZooKeeper.
