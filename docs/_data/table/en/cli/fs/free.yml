name: "free"
usage: "free [-f] <path>"
example: "For example, `free` can be used to manually manage Alluxioâ€™s data caching.\n\
  ```console\n$ ./bin/alluxio fs free /unused/data\n\n$ ./bin/alluxio fs pin /tmp/data\n\
  $ ./bin/alluxio fs free -f /tmp/data\n```"
subCommands: null
description: "The `free` command sends a request to the master to evict all blocks\
  \ of a file from the Alluxio workers.\nIf the argument to `free` is a directory,\
  \ it will recursively `free` all files. This request is not guaranteed\nto take\
  \ effect immediately, as readers may be currently using the blocks of the file.\
  \ `free` will return immediately\nafter the request is acknowledged by the master.\
  \ Note that files must be already persisted in under storage before\nbeing freed\
  \ or the free command will fail. Any pinned files cannot be freed unless -f option\
  \ is specified.\nThe `free` command does not delete any data from the under storage\
  \ system, only removing the blocks of those files\nin Alluxio space to reclaim space.\
  \ Metadata is not affected by this operation; a freed file will still show up if\
  \ an `ls` command is run.\n"
options:
- "`-f` force to free files even pinned"
