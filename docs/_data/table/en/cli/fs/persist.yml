name: "persist"
usage: "persist [-p|--parallelism <#>] [-t|--timeout <milliseconds>] [-w|--wait <milliseconds>]\
  \ <path> [<path> ...]"
example: "For example, `persist` can be used after filtering a series of temporary\
  \ files for the ones containing useful data.\n```console\n$ ./bin/alluxio fs persist\
  \ /tmp/experimental-logs-2.txt\n\n$ ./bin/alluxio fs persist -w 300 /tmp/exampleFile.txt\n\
  ```"
subCommands: null
description: "The `persist` command persists data in Alluxio storage into the under\
  \ storage system.\nThis is a server side data operation and will take time depending\
  \ on how large the file is.\nAfter persist is complete, the file in Alluxio will\
  \ be backed by the file in the under storage,\nand will still be available if the\
  \ Alluxio blocks are evicted or otherwise lost.\n\nIf you are persisting multiple\
  \ files, you can use the `--parallelism <#>` option to submit `#` of persist\ncommands\
  \ in parallel. For example, if your folder has 10,000 files, persisting with a parallelism\
  \ factor\nof 10 will persist 10 files at a time until all 10,000 files are persisted.\n"
options:
- "`-p` Number of concurrent persist operations, default: 4"
- "`-t` Time in milliseconds for a single file persist to time out; default:1200000"
- "`-w` The time to wait before persisting. default: 0"
