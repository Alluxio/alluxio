name: "load"
usage: "load [--local] <path>"
example: "For example, `loadMetadata` can be used when other systems output to the\
  \ under storage directly\nand the application running on Alluxio needs to use the\
  \ output of those systems.\n```console\n$ ./bin/alluxio fs loadMetadata /hdfs/data/2015/logs-1.txt\n\
  \n$ ./bin/alluxio fs loadMetadata --local /tmp/file3/examples.txt\n```"
subCommands: null
description: "The `load` command moves data from the under storage system into Alluxio\
  \ storage.\nIf there is a Alluxio worker on the machine this command is run from,\n\
  the data will be loaded to that worker. Otherwise, a random worker will be selected\
  \ to serve the data.\n\nIf the data is already loaded into Alluxio, load is a no-op\
  \ unless the `--local` flag is used. The `--local`\nflag forces the data to be loaded\
  \ to a local worker even if the data is already available on a remote worker.\n\
  If load is run on a directory, files in the directory will be recursively loaded.\n"
options:
- "`--local` load the file to local worker."
