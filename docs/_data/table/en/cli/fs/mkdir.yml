example: "For example, `mkdir` can be used by an admin to set up the basic folder\
  \ structures.\n```console\n$ ./bin/alluxio fs mkdir /users\n$ ./bin/alluxio fs mkdir\
  \ /users/Alice\n$ ./bin/alluxio fs mkdir /users/Bob\n```"

description: "The `mkdir` command creates a new directory in Alluxio space.\nIt is\
  \ recursive and will create any nonexistent parent directories. Note that the created\
  \ directory\nwill not be created in the under storage system until a file in the\
  \ directory is persisted to the underlying\nstorage. Using mkdir on an invalid or\
  \ existing path will fail.\n"
