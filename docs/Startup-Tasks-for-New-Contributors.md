#### After the pull request is reviewed and merged, you become a Tachyon contributor!

### Submitting Code

-   Break your work into small, single-purpose patches if possible. Itâ€™s
    much harder to merge in a large change with a lot of disjoint
    features.
-   Submit the patch as a GitHub pull request. For a tutorial, see the
    GitHub guides on [forking a repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and
    [sending a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).
-   Follow the style of the existing codebase. Specifically, we use
    [Sun's conventions](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/codeconv-138413.html),
    with the following changes:
    -   Indent two spaces per level, not four.
    -   Maximum line length of 100 characters.
    -   `i ++` instead of `i++`
    -   `i + j` instead of `i+j`

-   Make sure that your code passes the unit tests.
