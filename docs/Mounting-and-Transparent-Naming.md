Tachyon enables effective data management across different storage systems through its use of
transparent naming and mounting API.

## Transparent Naming

Transparent naming maintains an identity between the Tachyon namespace and the underlying storage
system namespace.

When a user creates objects in the Tachyon namespace, they can choose whether these objects should
be persisted in the underlying storage system. For objects that are persisted, Tachyon preserve the
object paths, relative to the underlying storage system directory in which Tachyon objects are
stored. For instance, if a user creates a top-level directory `Users` with subdirectories `Alice`
and `Bob`, the directory structure and naming is preserved in the underlying storage system (e.g.
HDFS or S3). Similarly, when a user renames or deletes a persisted object in the Tachyon namespace,
it is renamed or deleted in the underlying storage system.

Furthermore, Tachyon transparently discovers content present in the underlying storage system which
was not created through Tachyon. For instance, if the underlying storage system contains a directory
`Data` with files `Reports` and `Sales`, all of which were not created through Tachyon, their
metadata will be loaded into Tachyon the first time they are accessed (e.g. when the user asks to
list the contents of the top-level directory or when they request to open a file). The data of file
is not loaded to Tachyon during this process. To load the data into Tachyon, one can set the 
`TachyonStorageType` to `STORE` when reading the data for the first time or use the `load` command
of the Tachyon shell.

## Mounting API

Mounting API makes it possible to use Tachyon to access data across multiple data sources.

By default, Tachyon namespace is mounted onto the directory specified by the
`tachyon.underfs.address` property of Tachyon configuration; this directory identifies the
"primary storage" for Tachyon. In addition, users can use the mounting API to add new and remove
existing data sources:

```java
bool mount(String tachyonPath, String ufsPath);
bool unmount(String tachyonPath);
```

For example, the primary storage could be HDFS and contains user directories; the `Data` directory
might be stored in an S3 bucket, which is mounted to the Tachyon namespace through the
`mount(tachyon://host:port/Data, s3://bucket/directory)` invocation.

## Example

In this example, we will showcase the above features. The example assumes that Tachyon source code
exists in the `${TACHYON_HOME}` directory and that there is an instance of Tachyon running locally.

First, let's create a temporary directory in the local file system that to use for the example:

```bash
$ cd /tmp
$ mkdir tachyon-demo
```

Next, let's mount the directory created above into Tachyon and verify the mounted directory is
created in Tachyon:

```bash
$ ${TACHYON_HOME}/bin/tachyon tfs mount /demo /tmp/tachyon-demo
> Mounted /tmp/tachyon-demo at /demo
$ ${TACHYON_HOME}/bin/tachyon tfs ls /
... # should contain /demo
```

Next, let's create two files under the mounted directory and verify it is created in the underlying
file system:

```bash
$ ${TACHYON_HOME}/bin/tachyon tfs touch /demo/hello
> /demo/hello has been created
$ ${TACHYON_HOME}/bin/tachyon tfs touch /demo/hello2
> /demo/hello2 has been created
$ ls /tmp/tachyon-demo
> hello	hello2
```

Next, let's rename one of the files and verify it is renamed in the underlying file system:

```bash
$ ${TACHYON_HOME}/bin/tachyon tfs mv /demo/hello2 /demo/world
> Renamed /demo/hello2 to /demo/world
$ ls /tmp/tachyon-demo
> hello world
```

Next, let's delete one of the files and verify it is deleted in the underlying file system:

```bash
$ ${TACHYON_HOME}/bin/tachyon tfs rm /demo/world
> /demo/world has been removed
$ ls /tmp/tachyon-demo
> hello
```

Finally, let's unmount the mounted directory and verify that it is removed from the Tachyon
namespace, but its contents are preserved in the underlying file system:

```bash
${TACHYON_HOME}/bin/tachyon tfs unmount /demo
> Unmounted /demo
$ ${TACHYON_HOME}/bin/tachyon tfs ls /
... # should not contain /demo
$ ls /tmp/tachyon-demo
> hello
```
