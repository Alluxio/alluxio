title: Command Line Interface
---

Tachyon's command line interface provides users basic file system operations. Invoke the
command line utility with the script:

    $ ./bin/tachyon tfs

All "path" variables in tfs commands should start with

    tachyon://<master node address>:<master node port>/<path>

Or, if no header is provided, the default hostname and port (set in the env file) will be used.

    /<path>
