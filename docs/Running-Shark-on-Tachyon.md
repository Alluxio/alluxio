title: Running Shark on Tachyon
---

The additional prerequisite for this part is [Shark](https://github.com/amplab/shark/wiki).
We also assume that the user has set up Tachyon and Hadoop in accordance to these guides
[Local Mode](Running-Tachyon-Locally.html) or [Cluster Mode](Running-Tachyon-on-a-Cluster.html).

Shark 0.7 adds a new storage format to support efficiently reading data from
[Tachyon](http://tachyonproject.org), which enables data sharing and isolation across instances of
Shark. Our meetup [slide](http://goo.gl/fVmxCG) gives a good overview of the benefits of using
Tachyon to cache Shark's tables. In summary, the followings are four major ones:

-   In-memory data sharing across multiple Shark instances (i.e. stronger isolation)
-   Instant recovery of in-memory tables
-   Reduce heap size =\> faster GC in shark
-   If the table is larger than the memory size, only the hot columns will be cached in memory

### Setup

**Shark Compatibility:** Shark 0.7.x works with Tachyon 0.2.1,
Shark 0.8.1 works with Tachyon 0.3.0, Shark 0.9.0 works with Tachyon 0.4.0.

In order to use Spark on Tachyon, you need to setup `Tachyon 0.4.0` first, either
[Local Mode](https://github.com/amplab/tachyon/wiki/Running-Tachyon-Locally),
or [Cluster Mode](https://github.com/amplab/tachyon/wiki/Running-Tachyon-on-a-Cluster),
with HDFS.

Then, edit `shark-env.sh` and add

    export TACHYON_MASTER="TachyonMasterHost:TachyonMasterPort"
    export TACHYON_WAREHOUSE_PATH=/sharktables

### Cache Shark table in Tachyon

##### Specify TBLPROPERTIES(“shark.cache” = “tachyon”), for example:

    CREATE TABLE data TBLPROPERTIES(“shark.cache” = “tachyon”) AS SELECT a, b, c from data_on_disk WHERE month=“May”;

##### Specify table's name ending with \_tachyon, for example:

    CREATE TABLE orders_tachyon AS SELECT * FROM orders;

After creating the table in Tachyon, you can query it like query normal tables.
