Tachyon can achieve high throughput writes and reads, without compromising fault-tolerance by using
*Lineage*, where lost output is recovered by re-executing the jobs that created the output.

With lineage, applications write output into memory, and Tachyon periodically checkpoints the output
into the under file system in an asynchronous fashion. In case of failures, Tachyon launches *job
recomputation* to restore the lost files. To use lineage, the job must be deterministic so that the
re-execution can output identical files.

# Enable Lineage

By default, lineage is not enabled. It can be enabled by setting parameter
`tachyon.user.lineage.enabled` to `true` in the configuration file.

# Lineage API

Tachyon provides a Java like API for managing and accessing lineage information.

### Getting a Lineage Client

To obtain a Tachyon Lineage Client in Java code, use:

    TachyonLineage tl = TachyonLineage.get();

### Creating a lineage record

Lineage can be created by calling
`TachyonLineage#createLineage(List<TachyonURI>, List<TachyonURI>, Job)`. A lineage record takes (1)
a list of URIs to the input files, (2) a list of URIs of the output files, and (3) a *job*. A job
essentially is a program that can run by Tachyon for recomputation. *Note: at Lineage Alpha, only a
built-in `CommandLineJob` is supported, which simply takes a string of command that can run in
terminal. In addition, the user needs to provide the necessary configurations and execution
environments to ensure the command can be executed both at the client and at Tachyon master (during
recomputation).*

For example,

    TachyonLineage tl = TachyonLineage.get();
    // input file paths
    TachyonURI input1 = new TachyonURI("/inputFile1");
    TachyonURI input2 = new TachyonURI("/inputFile2");
    List<TachyonURI> inputFiles = Lists.newArrayList(input1, input2);
    // output file paths
    TachyonURI output = new TachyonURI("/outputFile");
    List<TachyonURI> outputFiles = Lists.newArrayList(output);
    // command-line job
    JobConf conf = new JobConf("/tmp/recompute.log");
    CommandLineJob job = new CommandLineJob("my-spark-job.sh", conf);
    long lineageId = tl.createLineage(inputFiles, outputFiles, job);

The `createLineage` function returns the id of the newly created lineage record. Before creating a
lineage record, make sure that all the input files are either persisted, or created as another
lineage recordâ€™s output.

### Specifying Operation Options

For all `TachyonLineage` operations, an additional `options` field may be specified, which allows
users to specify non-default settings for the operation

### Deleting a Lineage

Lineage records can be deleted by calling `TachyonLineage#deleteLineage`. The deletion function
takes the lineage id.

    TachyonLineage tl = TachyonLineage.get();
    tl.deleteLineage(1);

By default, the lineage record to delete cannot have output files depended by other lineages.
Optionally, all the downstream lineages can be deleted altogether by setting the cascade delete
flag. For example:

    TachyonLineage tl = TachyonLineage.get();
     DeleteLineageOptions options =
        new DeleteLineageOptions.Builder(new TachyonConf()).setCascade(true).build();
    tl.deleteLineage(1, options);

# Configuration Parameters For Lineage

<table class="table-striped">
<tr><th>Parameter</th><th>Default Value</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>
  <td>tachyon.master.lineage.checkpoint.interval.ms</td>
  <td>600000</td>
