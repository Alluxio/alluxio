# Run Tachyon Standalone on a Single Machine.

The prerequisite for this part is that you have [Java](Java-Setup.html) (JDK 6 or above).

Download the binary distribution of Tachyon {{site.TACHYON_RELEASED_VERSION}}:

```bash
$ wget http://tachyon-project.org/downloads/files/{{site.TACHYON_RELEASED_VERSION}}/tachyon-{{site.TACHYON_RELEASED_VERSION}}-bin.tar.gz
$ tar xvfz tachyon-{{site.TACHYON_RELEASED_VERSION}}-bin.tar.gz
$ cd tachyon-{{site.TACHYON_RELEASED_VERSION}}
```

Before executing Tachyon run scripts, requisite environment variables must be specified in
`conf/tachyon-env.sh`, which can be copied from the included template file:

```bash
$ cp conf/tachyon-env.sh.template conf/tachyon-env.sh
```

To run in standalone mode, make sure that:

* `TACHYON_UNDERFS_ADDRESS` in `conf/tachyon-env.sh` is set to a tmp directory in the local
filesystem (e.g., `export TACHYON_UNDERFS_ADDRESS=/tmp`).

* Remote login service is turned on so that `ssh localhost` can succeed.

Then, you can format Tachyon FileSystem and start it. *Note: since Tachyon needs to setup
[RAMFS](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/filesystems/ramfs-rootfs-initramfs.txt), starting a
local system requires users to input their root password for Linux based users. To avoid the need to
repeatedly input the root password, you can add the public ssh key for the host into 
`~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.*

```bash
$ ./bin/tachyon format
$ ./bin/tachyon-start.sh local
```

To verify that Tachyon is running, you can visit
**[http://localhost:19999](http://localhost:19999)**, or see the log in the `logs` folder. You can
also run a sample program:

```bash
$ ./bin/tachyon runTest Basic CACHE_THROUGH
```

For the first sample program, you should be able to see something similar to the following:

    /default_tests_files/BasicFile_CACHE_THROUGH has been removed

    Passed the test!

And you can visit Tachyon web UI at **[http://localhost:19999](http://localhost:19999)** again.
Click `Browse File System` in the navigation bar and you should see the files written to Tachyon by
the above test.

To run a more comprehensive sanity check:

```bash
$ ./bin/tachyon runTests
```

You can stop Tachyon any time by running:

```bash
$ ./bin/tachyon-stop.sh
```
