title: Metrics System
---

Metrics provide insight to what is going on in the cluster. They are an invaluable resource for
monitoring the services and debugging problems. Tachyon has a configurable metrics system based
on the [Coda Hale Metrics Library](https://github.com/dropwizard/metrics). In the metrics system,
metrics sources are where the metrics generated, and metrics sinks consume the records generated
by the metrics sources. The metrics system would poll the metrics sources periodically and pass
the metrics records to the metrics sinks.

Tachyon's metrics are decoupled into different instances corresponding to Tachyon components.
Within each instance, user can configure a set of sinks to which metrics are reported. The
following instances are currently supported:

* Master: The Tachyon standalone master process.
* Worker: The Tachyon standalone worker process.

Each instance can report to zero or more sinks.

* ConsoleSink: Outputs metrics values to the console.
* CsvSink: Exports metrics data to CSV files at regular intervals.
* JmxSink: Registers metrics for viewing in a JMX console.
* GraphiteSink: Sends metrics to a Graphite server.
* MetricsServlet: Adds a servlet in Web UI to serve metrics data as JSON data.

Some metrics like `BytesReadLocal` rely on data collected from client heartbeat. To get the
accurate metrics data, the client is expected to properly close the `TachyonFS` client after
using it.

#Configuration
The metrics system is configured via a configuration file that Tachyon expects to be present at
`$TACHYON_HOME/conf/metrics.properties`. A custom file location can be specified via the
`tachyon.metrics.conf.file` configuration property. Tachyon provides a metrics.properties.template
under the conf directory which includes all configurable properties. By default, MetricsServlet
is enabled and you can send HTTP request "/metrics/json" to get a snapshot of all the registered
metrics in JSON format.
