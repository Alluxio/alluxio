# An Alluxio master will be started on each of the machines listed below.
#
# In HA mode, Alluxio will use internal leader election or Zookeeper leader election
# to decide which of the masters should act as the primary. In non-HA mode, the master started
# on the host identified by the first entry in this file will act as the primary; the remaining hosts
# will be used to start a standby; which are responsible for journal compaction.
#
# The multi-master Zookeeper HA mode requires that all the masters can access
# the same journal through a shared medium (e.g. HDFS or NFS).
