#  syntax: sink.[name].[options]=[value]

#  This file configures Alluxio's internal metrics system.
#  The metrics can be configured to report its metrics to one or more sinks. The master, worker
#  and client can have different configurations.
#
#  A "sink" specifies where metrics are delivered to. One or more sinks can be assigned.
#
#  The [name] field specifies the name of a sink.
#
#  The [options] field is the specific property of this source or sink. The
#  source or sink is responsible for parsing this property.
#
#  Notes:
#    1. To add a new sink, set the "class" option to a fully qualified class
#    name (see examples below).
#    2. Some sinks involve a polling period. The minimum allowed polling period
#    is 1 second.
#    3. A metrics specific configuration
#    "alluxio.metrics.conf.file=${ALLUXIO_HOME}/conf/metrics.properties" should be
#    added to Java properties using -Dalluxio.metrics.conf.file=xxx if you want to
#    customize metrics system. You can also put the file in ${ALLUXIO_HOME}/conf
#    and it will be loaded automatically.
