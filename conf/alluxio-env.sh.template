# site. This file is sourced to launch Alluxio servers or use Alluxio shell

# following listed environment variables. Note that, setting this file will not
# affect jobs (e.g., Spark job or MapReduce job) that are using Alluxio client
# as a library. Alternatively, it is recommended to create alluxio-site.properties file,
# which supports all the configuration options provided by Alluxio
# (https://docs.alluxio.io/os/user/stable/en/reference/Properties-List.html),
# and is respected by both external jobs and Alluxio servers (or shell).
