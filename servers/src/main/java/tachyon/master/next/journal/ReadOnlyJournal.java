 * This encapsulates the journal for a master. The journal is made up of 2 components:
 * - The checkpoint: the full state of the master
 * - The entries: incremental entries to apply to the checkpoint.
 *
 * To construct the full state of the master, all the entries must be applied to the checkpoint in
 * order. The entry file most recently being written to is in the base journal folder, where the
 * completed entry files are in the "completed/" sub-directory.
