# Differences among EC2 instance types: http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/
# When using spark, we recommend "r3.large", compile spark needs 2G memory at least

# By default, EC2 instance only mounts 10GB under root directory '/'
# Different instance types provide different amount of extra disk spaces,
# but if you do not specify these extra disks in block device mapping, they won't be used.

# If you need to specify this field, don't forget to delete the "[]"
# The devices specified here will be automatically formatted to ext4 and
