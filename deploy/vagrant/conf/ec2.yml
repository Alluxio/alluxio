# Differences among EC2 instance types: http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/
#
# When using spark, we recommend "r3.large", compile spark needs 2G memory at least
#
# Some Instance Type must need PV/HVM(refer to AMI below)
Instance_Type: "t2.small"

# tag to the instance name to avoid name conflict during multiple deployment.
# specify this to illustrate the usage of your cluster, especially when you
# share the EC2 with others, without tags, it's hard to tell which cluster is yours. 
#
# The machines will be named to {Tag}TachyonMaster, {Tag}TachyonWorker1...
Tag: "my-"

# By default, EC2 instance only mounts 10GB under root directory '/'.
# Different instance types provide different amount of extra disk spaces,
# but if you do not specify these extra disks in block device mapping, they won't be used.
# Also, you can specify EBS disks here.
#
# For more info:
#   http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/block-device-mapping-concepts.html
#
# If you need to specify this field, don't forget to delete the "[]".
# The devices specified here will be automatically formatted to ext4 and
# mounted to "/disk0", "/disk1"... in sequence.
#
# If ufs is HDFS, all the /disk* will be used as HDFS's storage,
# Otherwise, all the /disk* will be used as Tachyon's HDD Tiered Storage.
#
# Example: 
# 1. Instance Extra Storage(If the Storage colume specified in instance type matrix
#    http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/ is not "EBS Only")
# 2. EBS Storage
Block_Device_Mapping: []
#  - DeviceName: "/dev/sdz" # EBS Storage
#    VirtualName: "ebs1"
#    Ebs.VolumeSize: "100" #GB
#    Ebs.DeleteOnTermination: "true"
#  - DeviceName: "/dev/sdf" # Instance Extra Storage
#    VirtualName: "ephemeral0" 
#  - DeviceName: "/dev/sdg"
#    VirtualName: "ephemeral1"
#    # for 2 x 16 SSD, one is "ephemeral0", another is "ephemeral1", 
#    # for more, increase the count to "ephemeral2"...
