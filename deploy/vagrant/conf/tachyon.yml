# Number of Tachyon masters in the cluster, should be at least 1.
# The cluster will be in fault tolerant mode if the number is larger than 1.
# When it is in fault tolerant mode, the masters will be named as TachyonMaster, TachyonMaster2, etc,
# currently, zookeeper is installed in /zookeeper and is a single node deployment, its server process runs on TachyonMaster.
# This option only has effect when Tachyon is run directly on the host instead of on top of frameworks like mesos or yarn.
# TODO(cc) Make spot instance request support multi-master
