name: unmount
usage: unmount <alluxioPath>
description: |
  The `unmount` command disassociates an Alluxio path with an under storage directory.
  Alluxio metadata for the mount point is removed along with any data blocks,
  but the under storage system will retain all metadata and data.
examples: |
  For example, `unmount` can be used to remove an under storage system when the users no longer need data from that system
  ```console
  $ ./bin/alluxio fs unmount /s3/data
  ```
