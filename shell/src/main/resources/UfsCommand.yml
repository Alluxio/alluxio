description: |
  The `ufs` command provides options to update attributes of a mounted under storage.
  The option mode can be used to put an under storage in maintenance mode.
  Certain operations can be restricted at this moment.
example: |
  An under storage can enter `readOnly` mode to disallow write operations.
  Alluxio will not attempt any write operations on the under storage.
  ```console
  $ ./bin/alluxio fsadmin ufs --mode readOnly hdfs://ns
