name: setReplication
usage: setReplication [-R] [--max <num> | --min <num>] <path>
description: |
  The `setReplication` command sets the max and/or min replication level of a file or all files
    under a directory recursively. This is a metadata operation and will not cause any replication
    to be created or removed immediately. The replication level of the target file or directory will
    be changed automatically in background. This command takes an argument of `--min` to specify the
    minimal replication level and `--max` for the maximal replication. Specify `-1` as the argument of
    `--max` option to indicate no limit of the maximum number of replicas. If the specified path is a directory
    and `-R` is specified, it will recursively set all files in this directory.
