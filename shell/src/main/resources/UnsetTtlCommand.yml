name: unsetTtl
usage: unsetTtl <path>
description: |
  The `unsetTtl` command will remove the TTL attributes of a file or directory in Alluxio.
    This is a metadata operation and will not evict or store blocks in Alluxio. The TTL of a
    file can later be reset with `setTtl.`
example: |
  For example, `unsetTtl` can be used if a regularly managed file requires manual management.
    ```console
    $ ./bin/alluxio fs unsetTtl /data/yesterday/data-not-yet-analyzed
    ```
