name: mount
usage: mount [--readonly] [--shared] [--option <key=val>] <alluxioPath> <ufsURI>
description: |
  The `mount` command links an under storage path to an Alluxio path,
  where files and folders created in Alluxio space under the path will be backed by a
  corresponding file or folder in the under storage path. For more details.

  Note that `--readonly` mounts are useful to prevent accidental write operations.
  If multiple Alluxio satellite clusters mount a remote storage cluster which serves as the
  central source of truth, `--readonly` option could help prevent any write operations on the
  satellite cluster from wiping out the remote storage.
example: |
  For example, `mount` can be used to make data in another storage system available in Alluxio.
  ```console
  $ ./bin/alluxio fs mount /mnt/hdfs hdfs://host1:9000/data/
  $ ./bin/alluxio fs mount --shared --readonly /mnt/hdfs2 hdfs://host2:9000/data/
  $ ./bin/alluxio fs mount \
  > --option aws.accessKeyId=<accessKeyId> \
  > --option aws.secretKey=<secretKey> \
  > /mnt/s3 s3://data-bucket/
  ```
