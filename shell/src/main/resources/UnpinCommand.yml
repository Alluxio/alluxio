name: unpin
usage: unpin <path>
description: |
  The `unpin` command unmarks a file or directory in Alluxio as pinned.
  This is a metadata operation and will not evict or delete any data blocks.
  Once a file is unpinned, its data blocks can be evicted from the various Alluxio workers containing the block.
example: |
  For example, `unpin` can be used when the administrator knows there is a change in the data access pattern.
  ```console
  $ ./bin/alluxio fs unpin /data/yesterday/join-table
  ```
