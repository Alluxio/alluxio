name: checkpoint
usage: checkpoint
description: |
  creates a `checkpoint` in the primary master journal system. This command
  is mainly used for debugging and to avoid master journal logs
  from growing unbounded. Checkpointing requires a pause in master metadata changes,
  so use this command sparingly to avoid interfering with other users of the system.
example: |
  ```console
  $ ./bin/alluxio fsadmin checkpoint
  ```
