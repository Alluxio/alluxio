name: ls
usage: ls [-d|-f|-p|-R|-h|--sort=option|--timestamp=option|-r] <path>
description: |
  The `ls` command lists all the immediate children in a directory and displays the file size,
  last modification time, and in memory status of the files. Using `ls` on a file will only display
  the information for that specific file.

  The `ls` command will also load the metadata for any file or immediate children of a directory from the
  under storage system to Alluxio namespace if it does not exist in Alluxio. `ls` queries the under storage system
  for any file or directory matching the given path and creates a mirror of the file in Alluxio backed by that file.
  Only the metadata, such as the file name and size, are loaded this way and no data transfer occurs.
examples: |
  For example, ls can be used to browse the file system.
  ```console
  $ ./bin/alluxio fs mount /s3/data s3://data-bucket/
  # Loads metadata for all immediate children of /s3/data and lists them.
  $ ./bin/alluxio fs ls /s3/data/

  # Forces loading metadata.
  $ aws s3 cp /tmp/somedata s3://data-bucket/somedata
  $ ./bin/alluxio fs ls -f /s3/data

  # Files are not removed from Alluxio if they are removed from the UFS (s3 here) only.
  $ aws s3 rm s3://data-bucket/somedata
  $ ./bin/alluxio fs ls -f /s3/data

  $ ./bin/alluxio fs ls -Rf /
  ```
