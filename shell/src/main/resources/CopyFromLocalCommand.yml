name: copyFromLocal
usage: copyFromLocal [--thread <num>] [--buffersize <bytes>] <src> <remoteDst>
description: |
  The `copyFromLocal` command copies the contents of a file in the local file system into Alluxio.
  If the node you run the command from has an Alluxio worker, the data will be available on that worker.
  Otherwise, the data will be copied to a random remote node running an Alluxio worker. If a directory is specified,
  the directory and all its contents will be copied recursively.
examples: |
  For example, `copyFromLocal` can be used as a quick way to inject data into the system for processing.
  ```console
  $ ./bin/alluxio fs copyFromLocal /local/data /input
  ```
