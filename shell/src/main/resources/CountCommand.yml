description: |
  The `count` command outputs the number of files and folders matching a prefix as well as the total size of the files.
    `count` works recursively and accounts for any nested directories and files.
    `count` is best utilized when the user has some predefined naming conventions for their files.
example: |
  For example, if data files are stored by their date, `count` can be used to determine the number of data files
    and their total size for any date, month, or year.
    ```console
    $ ./bin/alluxio fs count /data/2014
    ```
