name: stat
usage: stat [-f <format>] <path>
description: |
  The `stat` command dumps the FileInfo representation of a file or a directory to the console.
  It is primarily intended to assist power users in debugging their system.
  Generally viewing the file info in the UI will be easier to understand.

  One can specify `-f <arg>` to display info in given format:

    `%N`: name of the file
    `%z`: size of file in bytes
    `%u`: owner
    `%g`: group name of owner
    `%y` or `%Y`: modification time, where `%y` shows the UTC date in the form `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss`
      and `%Y` shows the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970 UTC
    `%b`: Number of blocks allocated for file
examples: |
  For example, `stat` can be used to debug the block locations of a file. This is useful
  when trying to achieve locality for compute workloads.
  ```console
  # Displays file's stat
  $ ./bin/alluxio fs stat /data/2015/logs-1.txt

  # Displays directory's stat
  $ ./bin/alluxio fs stat /data/2015

  # Displays the size of file
  $ ./bin/alluxio fs stat -f %z /data/2015/logs-1.txt
  ```
