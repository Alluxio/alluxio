  The `chmod` command changes the permission of file or directory in Alluxio.
  Currently, octal mode is supported: the numerical format accepts three octal
  digits which refer to permissions for the file owner, the group and other users.

  For example, `chown` can be used as a quick way to change the owner of file.
  ```console
  $ ./bin/alluxio fs chmod 755 /input/file1
  ```
