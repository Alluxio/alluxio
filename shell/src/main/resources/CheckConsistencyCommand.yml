name: checkConsictency
usage: checkConsistency [-r] [-t|--threads <threads>] <Alluxio path>
description: |
  The `checkConsistency` command compares Alluxio and under storage metadata for a given path.
    If the path is a directory, the entire subtree will be compared. The command returns a message listing
    each inconsistent file or directory. The system administrator should reconcile the differences of these
    files at their discretion. To avoid metadata inconsistencies between Alluxio and under storages, design
    your systems to modify files and directories through Alluxio and avoid directly modifying the under storage.

    NOTE: This command requires a read lock on the subtree being checked, meaning writes and updates to files or
    directories in the subtree cannot be completed until this command completes.
example: |
  For example, `checkConsistency` can be used to periodically validate the integrity of the namespace.
    ```console
    # List each inconsistent file or directory
    $ ./bin/alluxio fs checkConsistency /

    # Repair the inconsistent files or directories
    $ ./bin/alluxio fs checkConsistency -r /
    ```
