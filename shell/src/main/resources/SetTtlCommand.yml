name: setTtl
usage: setTtl [--action delete|free] <path> <time to live>
description: |
  The `setTtl` command sets the time-to-live of a file or a directory, in milliseconds.
    If set TTL is run on a directory, the same TTL attributes is set on all its children.
    If a directoryâ€™s TTL expires, all its children will also expire.

    Action parameter `--action` will indicate the action to perform once the file or directory expires.
    The default action, `delete`, deletes the file or directory from both Alluxio and the under storage system,
    whereas the action `free` frees the file from Alluxio even if pinned.
example: |
  For example, `setTtl` with action `delete` cleans up files the administrator knows are unnecessary
    after a period of time, or with action `free` just remove the contents from Alluxio
    to make room for more space in Alluxio.
    ```console
    # After 1 day, delete the file in Alluxio and UFS
    $ ./bin/alluxio fs setTtl /data/good-for-one-day 86400000
    # After 1 day, free the file from Alluxio
    $ ./bin/alluxio fs setTtl --action free /data/good-for-one-day 86400000
    ```
