description: |
  The `persist` command persists data in Alluxio storage into the under storage system.
    This is a server side data operation and will take time depending on how large the file is.
    After persist is complete, the file in Alluxio will be backed by the file in the under storage,
    and will still be available if the Alluxio blocks are evicted or otherwise lost.

    If you are persisting multiple files, you can use the `--parallelism <#>` option to submit `#` of persist
    commands in parallel. For example, if your folder has 10,000 files, persisting with a parallelism factor
    of 10 will persist 10 files at a time until all 10,000 files are persisted.

  For example, `mv` can be used to re-organize your files.
    ```console
    $ ./bin/alluxio fs mv /data/2014 /data/archives/2014
    ```
