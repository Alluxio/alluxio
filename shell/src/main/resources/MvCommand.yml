name: mv
usage: mv <src> <dst>
description: |
  The `mv` command moves a file or directory to another path in Alluxio.
  The destination path must not exist or be a directory. If it is a directory,
  the file or directory will be placed as a child of the directory.
  `mv` is purely a metadata operation and does not affect the data blocks of the file.
  `mv` cannot be done between mount points of different under storage systems.
example: |
  For example, `mv` can be used to re-organize your files.
  ```console
  $ ./bin/alluxio fs mv /data/2014 /data/archives/2014
  ```
