name: free
usage: free [-f] <path>
description: |
  The `free` command sends a request to the master to evict all blocks of a file from the Alluxio workers.
  If the argument to `free` is a directory, it will recursively `free` all files. This request is not guaranteed
  to take effect immediately, as readers may be currently using the blocks of the file. `free` will return immediately
  after the request is acknowledged by the master. Note that files must be already persisted in under storage before
  being freed or the free command will fail. Any pinned files cannot be freed unless -f option is specified.
  The `free` command does not delete any data from the under storage system, only removing the blocks of those files
  in Alluxio space to reclaim space. Metadata is not affected by this operation; a freed file will still show up if an `ls` command is run.
example: |
  For example, `free` can be used to manually manage Alluxioâ€™s data caching.
  ```console
  $ ./bin/alluxio fs free /unused/data

  $ ./bin/alluxio fs pin /tmp/data
  $ ./bin/alluxio fs free -f /tmp/data
  ```
