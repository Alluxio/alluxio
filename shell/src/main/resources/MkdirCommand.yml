name: mkdir
usage: mkdir <path1> [path2] ... [pathn]
description: |
  The `mkdir` command creates a new directory in Alluxio space.
    It is recursive and will create any nonexistent parent directories. Note that the created directory
    will not be created in the under storage system until a file in the directory is persisted to the underlying
    storage. Using mkdir on an invalid or existing path will fail.
example: |
  For example, `mkdir` can be used by an admin to set up the basic folder structures.
    ```console
    $ ./bin/alluxio fs mkdir /users
    $ ./bin/alluxio fs mkdir /users/Alice
    $ ./bin/alluxio fs mkdir /users/Bob
    ```
