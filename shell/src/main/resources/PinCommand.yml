description: |
  The `pin` command marks a file or folder as pinned in Alluxio.
  This is a metadata operation and will not cause any data to be loaded into Alluxio.
  If a file is pinned, any blocks belonging to the file will never be evicted from an Alluxio worker.
  If there are too many pinned files, Alluxio workers may run low on storage space, preventing
  other files from being cached.
example: |
  For example, `pin` can be used to manually ensure performance if the administrator understands the workloads well.
  ```console
  $ ./bin/alluxio fs pin /data/today
  ```
