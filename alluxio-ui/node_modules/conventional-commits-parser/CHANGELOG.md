### Performance Improvements

* **regex:** regex should be constructed in index.html ([15afd26](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-commits-parser/commit/15afd26))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* **merge:** `pull request` should be `merge`. Also make the parsed result to be consistent with other parts.
* This module is imported from https://github.com/ajoslin/conventional-changelog, and is originally written by @vojtajina, @btford and @ajoslin.
* **hash:** hash is no longer supported. This parser should just parse raw commit messages. Also text fields are appended with a newline "
".
* **regex:** It returns a nomatch regex if it's keywords are missing.
* **headerParts:** `headerParts` does not limit to `type`, `scope` and `subject`. They can now be defined in `options.headerCorrespondence` and the order is the order of capturing group in `options.headerPattern`. If part is missing in `options.headerCorrespondence` it is `undefined`. If part is not captured but is not missing in `options.headerCorrespondence` it is `null`.
* **maxSubjectLength:** `maxSubjectLength` is not available any more.
* **issuePrefixes:** `options.referenceKeywords` is now `options.referenceActions`
* **references:** `closes` now becomes `references` and it is loosely based the links above.
* **parser:** The regex for matching notes are loosen. The semicolon and space are optional. The `notes` object is no longer a key-value object but an array of note object, such as
```js
{
title: 'BREAKING AMEND',
text: 'some breaking change'
}
```
The detection of notes, closes, continueNote and isBody are mutually exclusive.
* **breaks:** Variable name related to `breaks` changes to `notes`, because "Important Notes" a more generic term. There is no functional changes.
* **stream:** It no longer skips the chunk if commit cannot be parsed. An empty string is passed to down stream
* **correspondence:** body and footer will be null if they are not found. type and subject are nullable too.
