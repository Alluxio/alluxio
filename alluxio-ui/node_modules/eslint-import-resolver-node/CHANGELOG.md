## Unreleased

## v0.3.2 - 2018-01-05
### Added
- `.mjs` extension detected by default to support `experimental-modules` (#939)

### Deps
- update `debug`, `resolve`

## v0.3.1 - 2017-06-23
### Changed
- bumped `debug` dep to match other packages

## v0.3.0 - 2016-12-15
### Changed
- bumped `resolve` to fix issues with Node builtins (thanks [@SkeLLLa] and [@ljharb])

### Fixed
- use `files` in `package.json` to ship only `index.js` ([#531], thanks for noticing [@lukeapage])

## v0.2.3 - 2016-08-20
### Added
- debug logging (use `DEBUG=eslint-plugin-import:resolver:node eslint [...]`)

## v0.2.2 - 2016-07-14
### Fixed
- Node resolver no longer declares the import plugin as a `peerDependency`. See [#437]
  for a well-articulated and thoughtful expression of why this doesn't make sense.
  Thanks [@jasonkarns] for the issue and the PR to fix it ([#438]).

  Also, apologies to the others who expressed this before, but I never understood
  what the problem was.ðŸ˜…

## v0.2.1
### Fixed
- find files with `.json` extensions (#333, thanks for noticing @jfmengels)
