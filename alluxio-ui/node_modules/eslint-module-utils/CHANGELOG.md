## Unreleased

## v2.3.0 - 2019-01-22
### Fixed
- use `process.hrtime()` for cache dates ([#1160], thanks [@hulkish])

## v2.2.0 - 2018-03-29
### Changed
- `parse`: attach node locations by default.
- `moduleVisitor`: visitor now gets the full `import` statement node as a second
  argument, so rules may report against the full statement / `require` call instead
  of only the string literal node.

## v2.1.1 - 2017-06-22

Re-releasing v2.1.0 after vetting (again) and unable to reproduce issue.


## v2.1.0 - 2017-06-02 [YANKED]

Yanked due to critical issue with cache key resulting from #839.

### Added
- `parse` now additionally passes `filePath` to `parser` in `parserOptions` like `eslint` core does

## v2.0.0 - 2016-11-07
### Changed
- `unambiguous` no longer exposes fast test regex

### Fixed
- `unambiguous.test()` regex is now properly in multiline mode
