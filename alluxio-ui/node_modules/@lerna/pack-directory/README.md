# `@lerna/pack-directory`

> Pack a directory into an npm package tarball

This package owes an immense debt of gratitude to [Kat March√°n](https://github.com/zkat), [Rebecca Turner](https://github.com/iarna), and all past contributors to npm for making such awesome software that I basically copied.

## Usage

You probably shouldn't, at least directly.

Install [lerna](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lerna) for access to the `lerna` CLI.
