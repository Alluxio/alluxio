 * The `callback` is invoked with three arguments:
 *
 *  - the property value
 *  - the property name
 *  - the object being traversed
 *
 * Properties that are added after the call to `everyObject` will not be
 * visited by `callback`. If the values of existing properties are changed, the
 * value passed to `callback` will be the value at the time `everyObject`
 * visits them. Properties that are deleted before being visited are not
