/**
 * Allows extraction of a minified key. Let's the build system minify keys
 * without losing the ability to dynamically use key strings as values
 * themselves. Pass in an object with a single key/val pair and it will return
 * you the string key of that single record. Suppose you want to grab the
 * value for a key 'className' inside of an object. Key/val minification may
 * have aliased that key to be 'xa12'. keyOf({className: null}) will return
 * 'xa12' in that case. Resolve keys you want to use once at startup time, then
 * reuse those resolutions.
