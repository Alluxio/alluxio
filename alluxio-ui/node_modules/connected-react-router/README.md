======================
A Redux binding for React Router v4

Main features
-------------
:sparkles: Synchronize router state with redux store through uni-directional flow (i.e. history -> store -> router -> components).

:gift: Support [React Router v4](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router).

:sunny: Support functional component hot reloading while preserving state (with [react-hot-reload](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader)).

:tada: Dispatching of history methods (`push`, `replace`, `go`, `goBack`, `goForward`) works for both [redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) and [redux-saga](https://github.com/yelouafi/redux-saga).

:snowman: Nested children can access routing state such as the current location directly with `react-redux`'s `connect`.

:clock9: Support time traveling in Redux DevTools.

:gem: Support [Immutable.js](https://facebook.github.io/immutable-js/)

:muscle: Support TypeScript


Installation
-----------
Connected React Router requires **React 16.4 and React Redux 6.0 or later**.


    $ npm install --save connected-react-router

Or

    $ yarn add connected-react-router

Usage
-----
### Step 1
In your root reducer file, 
- Create a function that takes `history` as an argument and returns a root reducer.
- Add `router` reducer into root reducer by passing `history` to `connectRouter`. 
- **Note: The key MUST be `router`**.
 
```js
// reducers.js
import { combineReducers } from 'redux'
import { connectRouter } from 'connected-react-router'

export default (history) => combineReducers({
  router: connectRouter(history),
  ... // rest of your reducers
})
```

### Step 2
When creating a Redux store,
- Create a `history` object.
- Provide the created `history` to the root reducer creator.
- Use `routerMiddleware(history)` if you want to dispatch history actions (e.g. to change URL with `push('/path/to/somewhere')`).


```js
// configureStore.js
...
import { createBrowserHistory } from 'history'
import { applyMiddleware, compose, createStore } from 'redux'
import { routerMiddleware } from 'connected-react-router'
import createRootReducer from './reducers'
...
export const history = createBrowserHistory()

export default function configureStore(preloadedState) {
  const store = createStore(
    createRootReducer(history), // root reducer with router state
    preloadedState,
    compose(
      applyMiddleware(
        routerMiddleware(history), // for dispatching history actions
        // ... other middlewares ...
      ),
    ),
  )

  return store
}
```

### Step 3

- Wrap your react-router v4 routing with `ConnectedRouter` and pass the `history` object as a prop.
- Place `ConnectedRouter` as a child of `react-redux`'s `Provider`.

```js
// index.js
...
import { Provider } from 'react-redux'
import { Route, Switch } from 'react-router' // react-router v4
import { ConnectedRouter } from 'connected-react-router'
import configureStore, { history } from './configureStore'
...
const store = configureStore(/* provide initial state if any */)

ReactDOM.render(
  <Provider store={store}>
    <ConnectedRouter history={history}> { /* place ConnectedRouter under Provider */ }
      <> { /* your usual react-router v4 routing */ }
        <Switch>
          <Route exact path="/" render={() => (<div>Match</div>)} />
          <Route render={() => (<div>Miss</div>)} />
        </Switch>
      </>
    </ConnectedRouter>
  </Provider>,
  document.getElementById('react-root')
)
```
Note: the `history` object provided to `router` reducer, `routerMiddleware`, and `ConnectedRouter` component must be the same `history` object.

Now, it's ready to work!

Build
-----
```bash
npm run build
```
Generated files will be in the `lib` folder.

Development
-----------
When testing the example apps with `npm link` or `yarn link`, you should explicitly provide the same `Context` to both `Provider` and `ConnectedRouter` to make sure that the `ConnectedRouter` doesn't pick up a different `ReactReduxContext` from a different `node_modules` folder.

In `index.js`.
```js
...
import { Provider, ReactReduxContext } from 'react-redux'
...
      <Provider store={store} context={ReactReduxContext}>
        <App history={history} context={ReactReduxContext} />
      </Provider>
...
```

In `App.js`,
```js
...
const App = ({ history, context }) => {
  return (
    <ConnectedRouter history={history} context={context}>
      { routes }
    </ConnectedRouter>
  )
}
...
```
