Connected React Router is based on several awesome peoples' ideas
- Several parts of Connected React Router are based on [react-router-redux v4](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-redux/tree/v4.0.7).
- A [PR](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-redux/pull/460) by @timdorr to make react-router-redux v5 integrate with React Router v4 contains several ideas to drive Connected React Router.
- The ConnectedRouter component is inspired by [App component by @cherijs](https://github.com/lourd/react-router4-redux-example/blob/master/src/App.js) with history synchronization enhancement.
- The idea of uni-directional flow (history -> store -> router -> components) is from [a @lourd's comment](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router-redux/pull/460#issuecomment-260999726)
