Please consider following this project's author, [Jon Schlinkert](https://github.com/jonschlinkert), and consider starring the project to show your :heart: and support.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save clone-deep
```

## Usage

```js
var cloneDeep = require('clone-deep');

var obj = {a: 'b'};
var arr = [obj];

var copy = cloneDeep(arr);
obj.c = 'd';

console.log(copy);
//=> [{a: 'b'}]

console.log(arr);
//=> [{a: 'b', c: 'd'}]
```

## Heads up!

The `instanceClone` function is invoked to clone objects that are not "plain" objects (as defined by [isPlainObject](#isPlainObject)`isPlainObject`) if it is provided. If `instanceClone` is not specified, it will not attempt to clone non-plain objects, and will copy the object reference.

## Attribution

Based on [mout's](https://github.com/mout/mout) implementation of deepClone.
