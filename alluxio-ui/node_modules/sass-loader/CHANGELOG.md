<a name="7.0.3"></a>
## [7.0.3](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/compare/v7.0.2...v7.0.3) (2018-06-05)


### Bug Fixes

* Bare imports not working sometimes (#579) ([c348281](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/commit/c348281)), closes [#566](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/566)



<a name="7.0.2"></a>
## [7.0.2](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/compare/v7.0.1...v7.0.2) (2018-06-02)


### Bug Fixes

* Errors being swallowed when trying to load node-sass (#576) ([6dfb274](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/commit/6dfb274)), closes [#563](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/563)
* Report error to user for problems loading node-sass (#562) ([2529c07](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/commit/2529c07))



<a name="7.0.1"></a>
## [7.0.1](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/compare/v7.0.0...v7.0.1) (2018-04-13)


### Bug Fixes

* Wrong import precedence (#557) ([f4eeff1](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/commit/f4eeff1))



<a name="7.0.0"></a>
# [7.0.0](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/compare/v6.0.7...v7.0.0) (2018-04-13)


### Features

* Refactor resolving and simplify webpack config aliases (#479) ([e0fde1a](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/commit/e0fde1a))
* Remove `node-sass` from `peerDependencies` (#533) ([6439cef](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/commit/6439cef))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* Drop official node 4 support
* This slightly changes the resolving algorithm. Should not break in normal usage, but might break in complex configurations.
* The sass-loader throws an error at runtime now and refuses to compile if the peer dependency is wrong. This could break applications where npm's peer dependency warning was just ignored.

### Bug Fixes

### Code Refactoring

* Refactor [import resolving algorithm](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/blob/089c52dc9bd02ec67fb5c65c2c226f43710f231c/index.js#L293-L348). ([#138](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/issues/138)) ([c8621a1](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader/commit/80944ccf09cd9716a100160c068d255c5d742338))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* The new algorithm is aligned to libsass' way of resolving files. This yields to different results if two files with the same path and filename but with different extensions are present. Though this change should be no problem for most users, we must flag it as breaking change.
