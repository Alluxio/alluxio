`config` prop added, accepts a

configuration

`accurate` prop added, use to get an accurate measurement, only height supported
right now

Upgraded to React 0.14.0

### 0.1.3

Added `forceAutoHeight` prop to help with proper height calculation when
children heights are animating

### 0.1.2

Clone prop now exposed to allow optional cloning of component

Defaults to false which could potentially break components relying on cloned
calculations

### 0.1.1

Set width/height to auto on clone no matter what to get a true dimension

Append clone directly after original instead of the end of its parent

Portal now gets destroyed after measurements have been calculated

### 0.1.0

Rewritten to be more React friendly

Measure component no longer accepts a child function, instead get dimensions by
setting state in onChange callback
