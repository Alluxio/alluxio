  ([@olore](https://github.com/olore))

### DEPENDENCY UPDATES

A very special dependency update event! Since the [release of
`node-gyp@3.8.0`](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/pull/1521), an awkward
version conflict that was preventing `request` from begin flattened was
resolved. This means two things:

1. We've cut down the npm tarball size by another 200kb, to 4.6MB
2. `npm audit` now shows no vulnerabilities for npm itself!

Thanks, [@rvagg](https://github.com/rvagg)!

## v6.2.0 (2018-07-13):

In case you missed it, [we
moved!](https://blog.npmjs.org/post/175587538995/announcing-npmcommunity). We
look forward to seeing future PRs landing in
[npm/cli](https://github.com/npm/cli) in the future, and we'll be chatting with
you all in [npm.community](https://npm.community). Go check it out!

This final release of `npm@6.2.0` includes a couple of features that weren't
quite ready on time but that we'd still like to include. Enjoy!

### FEATURES

  `request@2.81.0`: Downgraded to allow better deduplication. This does
  introduce a bunch of `hoek`-related audit reports, but they don't affect npm
  itself so we consider it safe. We'll upgrade `request` again once `node-gyp`
  unpins it.

## v6.1.0-next.0 (2018-05-17):

Look at that! A feature bump! `npm@6` was super-exciting not just because it
used a bigger number than ever before, but also because it included a super
shiny new command: `npm audit`. Well, we've kept working on it since then and
have some really nice improvements for it. You can expect more of them, and the
occasional fix, in the next few releases as more users start playing with it and
we get more feedback about what y'all would like to see from something like
this.

I, for one, have started running it (and the new subcommand...) in all my
projects, and it's one of those things that I don't know how I ever functioned
-without- it! This will make a world of difference to so many people as far as
making the npm ecosystem a higher-quality, safer commons for all of us.

This is also a good time to remind y'all that we have a new [RFCs
repository](https://github.com/npm/rfcs), along with a new process for them.
This repo is open to anyone's RFCs, and has already received some great ideas
about where we can take the CLI (and, to a certain extent, the registry). It's a
great place to get feedback, and completely replaces feature requests in the
main repo, so we won't be accepting feature requests there at all anymore. Check
it out if you have something you'd like to suggest, or if you want to keep track
of what the future might look like!

### NEW FEATURE: `npm audit fix`

This is the biggie with this release! `npm audit fix` does exactly what it says
on the tin. It takes all the actionable reports from your `npm audit` and runs
the installs automatically for you, so you don't have to try to do all that
mechanical work yourself!

Note that by default, `npm audit fix` will stick to semver-compatible changes,
so you should be able to safely run it on most projects and carry on with your
day without having to track down what breaking changes were included. If you
want your (toplevel) dependencies to accept semver-major bumps as well, you can
use `npm audit fix --force` and it'll toss those in, as well. Since it's running
the npm installer under the hood, it also supports `--production` and
`--only=dev` flags, as well as things like `--dry-run`, `--json`, and
`--package-lock-only`, if you want more control over what it does.

Give it a whirl and tell us what you think! See `npm help audit` for full docs!

* [`3800a660d`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/3800a660d99ca45c0175061dbe087520db2f54b7)

  `npm-audit-report@1.2.1`:
  Overhaul audit install and detail output format. The new format is terser and
  fits more closely into the visual style of the CLI, while still providing you
  with the important bits of information you need. They also include a bit more
  detail on the footer about what actions you can take!
  ([@zkat](https://github.com/zkat))

### NEW FEATURE: GIT DEPS AND `npm init <pkg>`!

Another exciting change that came with `npm@6` was the new `npm init` command
that allows for community-authored generators. That means you can, for example,
do `npm init react-app` and it'll one-off download, install, and run
[`create-react-app`](https://npm.im/create-react-app) for you, without requiring
or keeping around any global installs. That is, it basically just calls out to
[`npx`](https://npm.im/npx).

The first version of this command only really supported registry dependencies,
but now, [@jdalton](https://github.com/jdalton) went ahead and extended this
feature so you can use hosted git dependencies, and their shorthands.

So go ahead and do `npm init facebook/create-react-app` and it'll grab the
package from the github repo now! Or you can use it with a private github
repository to maintain your organizational scaffolding tools or whatnot. ✨

### AUDIT SHOULDN'T WAIT FOREVER

This will likely be reduced further with the goal that the audit process
shouldn't noticibly slow down your builds regardless of your network
situation.

don't warn about being used with it.

### CTRL-C OUT DURING PACKAGE EXTRACTION AS MUCH AS YOU WANT!

### SHRONKWRAPS AND LACKFILES

If a published modules had legacy `npm-shrinkwrap.json` we were saving
ordinary registry dependencies (`name@version`) to your `package-lock.json`
as `https://` URLs instead of versions.

* [`89102c0d9`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/89102c0d995c3d707ff2b56995a97a1610f8b532)
  When saving the lock-file compute how the dependency is being required instead of using
  `_resolved` in the `package.json`.  This fixes the bug that was converting
  registry dependencies into `https://` dependencies.

  the version and use them as registry dependencies.  This lets us heal
  `package-lock.json` files produced by 6.0.0

it even better when it is turned on!

## v6.0.0 (2018-04-20):

Hey y'all! Here's another `npm@6` release -- with `node@10` around the corner,
this might well be the last prerelease before we tag `6.0.0`! There's two major
features included with this release, along with a few miscellaneous fixes and
changes.

### EXTENDED `npm init` SCAFFOLDING

Thanks to the wonderful efforts of [@jdalton](https://github.com/jdalton) of
lodash fame, `npm init` can now be used to invoke custom scaffolding tools!

You can now do things like `npm init react-app` or `npm init esm` to scaffold an
npm package by running `create-react-app` and `create-esm`, respectively. This
also adds an `npm create` alias, to correspond to Yarn's `yarn create` feature,
which inspired this.

* [`008a83642`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/008a83642e04360e461f56da74b5557d5248a726) [`ed81d1426`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/ed81d1426776bcac47492cabef43f65e1d4ab536) [`833046e45`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/833046e45fe25f75daffd55caf25599a9f98c148)
  [#20303](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/20303)
  Add an `npm init` feature that calls out to `npx` when invoked with positional
  arguments.  ([@jdalton](https://github.com/jdalton))

### DEPENDENCY AUDITING

This version of npm adds a new command, `npm audit`, which will run a security
audit of your project's dependency tree and notify you about any actions you may
need to take.

The registry-side services required for this command to work will be available
on the main npm registry in the coming weeks. Until then, you won't get much out
of trying to use this on the CLI.

As part of this change, the npm CLI now sends scrubbed and cryptographically
anonymized metadata about your dependency tree to your configured registry, to
allow notifying you about the existence of critical security flaws. For details
about how the CLI protects your privacy when it shares this metadata, see `npm
help audit`, or [read the docs for `npm audit`
online](https://github.com/npm/npm/blob/release-next/doc/cli/npm-audit.md). You
can disable this altogether by doing `npm config set audit false`, but will no
longer benefit from the service.

  Add `from` field back into package-lock for git dependencies. This will give
  npm the information it needs to figure out whether git deps are valid,
  specially when running with legacy install metadata or in
  `--package-lock-only` mode when there's no `node_modules`. This should help
  remove a significant amount of git-related churn on the lock-file.

  [#20390](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/20390)
  Fix a scenario where a git dependency had a comittish associated with it
  that was not a complete commitid.  `npm` would never consider that entry
  in the `package.json` as matching the entry in the `package-lock.json` and
  this resulted in inappropriate pruning or reinstallation of git
  dependencies.  This has been addressed in two ways, first, the addition of the
  `from` field as described in [#20384](https://github.com/npm/npm/pull/20384) means
  we can exactly match the `package.json`. Second, when that's missing (when working with
  older `package-lock.json` files), we assume that the match is ok.  (If
  it's not, we'll fix it up when a real installation is done.)

## v6.0.0-0 (2018-03-23):

Sometimes major releases are a big splash, sometimes they're something
smaller.  This is the latter kind.  That said, we expect to keep this in
release candidate status until Node 10 ships at the end of April.  There
will likely be a few more features for the 6.0.0 release line between now
and then.  We do expect to have a bigger one later this year though, so keep
an eye out for `npm@7`!

### *BREAKING* AVOID DEPRECATED

When selecting versions to install, we now avoid deprecated versions if
possible. For example:

```
Module: example
Versions:
1.0.0
1.1.0
1.1.2
1.1.3 (deprecated)
1.2.0 (latest)
```

If you ask `npm` to install `example@~1.1.0`, `npm` will now give you `1.1.2`.

By contrast, if you installed `example@~1.1.3` then you'd get `1.1.3`, as
it's the only version that can match the range.

  Skip deprecated versions when possible.

### *BREAKING* UPDATE AND OUTDATED

When `npm install` is finding a version to install, it first checks to see
if the specifier you requested matches the `latest` tag.  If it doesn't,
then it looks for the highest version that does.  This means you can do
release candidates on tags other than `latest` and users won't see them
unless they ask for them.  Promoting them is as easy as setting the `latest`
tag to point at them.

Historically `npm update` and `npm outdated` worked differently.  They just
looked for the most recent thing that matched the semver range, disregarding
the `latest` tag. We're changing it to match `npm install`'s behavior.

  Make update and outdated respect latest interaction with semver as install does.

### PLUS ONE SMALLER PATCH

Technically this is a bug fix, but the change in behavior is enough of an
edge case that I held off on bringing it in until a major version.

When we extract a binary and it starts with a shebang (or "hash bang"), that
is, something like:

```
#!/usr/bin/env node
```

If the file has Windows line endings we strip them off of the first line.
The reason for this is that shebangs are only used in Unix-like environments
and the files with them can't be run if the shebang has a Windows line ending.

Previously we converted ALL line endings from Windows to Unix.  With this
patch we only convert the line with the shebang.  (Node.js works just fine
with either set of line endings.)

  [`7265198eb`](https://github.com/npm/npm/commit/7265198ebb32d35937f4ff484b0167870725b054)
  `bin-links@1.1.2`:
  Only rewrite the CR after a shebang (if any) when fixing up CR/LFs.

### *BREAKING* SUPPORTED NODE VERSIONS

Per our supported Node.js policy, we're dropping support for both Node 4 and
Node 7, which are no longer supported by the Node.js project.
