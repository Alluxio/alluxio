  </property>

   <property>
     <name>yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.default.maximum-application-lifetime
     </name>
     <value>-1</value>
     <description>
        Maximum lifetime of an application which is submitted to a queue
        in seconds. Any value less than or equal to zero will be considered as
        disabled.
        This will be a hard time limit for all applications in this
        queue. If positive value is configured then any application submitted
        to this queue will be killed after exceeds the configured lifetime.
        User can also specify lifetime per application basis in
        application submission context. But user lifetime will be
        overridden if it exceeds queue maximum lifetime. It is point-in-time
        configuration.
        Note : Configuring too low value will result in killing application
        sooner. This feature is applicable only for leaf queue.

   <property>
     <name>yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.default.default-application-lifetime
     </name>
     <value>-1</value>
     <description>
        Default lifetime of an application which is submitted to a queue
        in seconds. Any value less than or equal to zero will be considered as
        disabled.
        If the user has not submitted application with lifetime value then this
        value will be taken. It is point-in-time configuration.
        Note : Default lifetime can't exceed maximum lifetime. This feature is
        applicable only for leaf queue.

  <property>
    <name>yarn.scheduler.capacity.node-locality-delay</name>
    <value>40</value>
    <description>
      Number of missed scheduling opportunities after which the CapacityScheduler 
      attempts to schedule rack-local containers.
      When setting this parameter, the size of the cluster should be taken into account.
      We use 40 as the default value, which is approximately the number of nodes in one rack.
    </description>
  </property>

  <property>
    <name>yarn.scheduler.capacity.rack-locality-additional-delay</name>
    <value>-1</value>
    <description>
      Number of additional missed scheduling opportunities over the node-locality-delay
      ones, after which the CapacityScheduler attempts to schedule off-switch containers,
      instead of rack-local ones.
      Example: with node-locality-delay=40 and rack-locality-delay=20, the scheduler will
      attempt rack-local assignments after 40 missed opportunities, and off-switch assignments
      after 40+20=60 missed opportunities.
      When setting this parameter, the size of the cluster should be taken into account.
      We use -1 as the default value, which disables this feature. In this case, the number
      of missed opportunities for assigning off-switch containers is calculated based on
      the number of containers and unique locations specified in the resource request,
      as well as the size of the cluster.
    </description>
  </property>

  <property>
    <name>yarn.scheduler.capacity.queue-mappings</name>
    <value></value>
    <description>
      A list of mappings that will be used to assign jobs to queues
      The syntax for this list is [u|g]:[name]:[queue_name][,next mapping]*
      Typically this list will be used to map users to queues,
      for example, u:%user:%user maps all users to queues with the same name
      as the user.
    </description>
  </property>

  <property>
    <name>yarn.scheduler.capacity.queue-mappings-override.enable</name>
    <value>false</value>
    <description>
      If a queue mapping is present, will it override the value specified
      by the user? This can be used by administrators to place jobs in queues
      that are different than the one specified by the user.
      The default is false.
    </description>
  </property>

  <property>
    <name>yarn.scheduler.capacity.per-node-heartbeat.maximum-offswitch-assignments</name>
    <value>1</value>
    <description>
      Controls the number of OFF_SWITCH assignments allowed
      during a node's heartbeat. Increasing this value can improve
      scheduling rate for OFF_SWITCH containers. Lower values reduce
      "clumping" of applications on particular nodes. The default is 1.
      Legal values are 1-MAX_INT. This config is refreshable.
