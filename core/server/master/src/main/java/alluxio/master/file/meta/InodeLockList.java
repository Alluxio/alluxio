/**
 * Represents a locked path within the inode tree. Both inodes and edges are locked along the path.
 * The path may start from either an edge or an inode.
 *
 * A lock list always contains some number of read locks (possibly zero) followed by some number of
 * write locks (possibly zero).
 *
 * This class uses list notation to describe lock lists. Nodes are single letters, edges are
 * parentName->childName, and write-locks are indicated with '*'. For example, a lock list for
 * /a/b/c/d where the c->d edge is the first write-locked element:
 *
 * [->/, /, /->a, a, a->b, b, b->c, c, c->d*, d*]
 *
 * The "->/" at the start is a pseudo-edge used to allow the WRITE_EDGE lock mode to be applied to
 * the root. This edge can only be locked by calling lockRootEdge.
 *
 * Not all lock lists need to start from the root. Another example list could be
 *
 * [b, b->c, c->d*, d*]
 *
 * This allows us to create composite lock lists out of a "normal" lock list starting from the root,
 * plus a non-root lock list.
