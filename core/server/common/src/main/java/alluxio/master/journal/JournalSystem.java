/**
 * A journal system for storing and applying journal entries.
 *
 * To use the journal system, first create per-state-machine journals with the
 * {@link #createJournal(JournalEntryStateMachine)} method. Once all state machines are added,
 * {@link #start()} the journal system. The journal system starts in secondary mode, meaning it will
 * not accept writes, but will apply journal entries to keep state machine states up to date with
 * previously written journal entries.
 *
 * To enable writes, the journal system may be changed to
 * primary mode, where all state machines will first be caught up fully with the latest journal
 * updates, then begin to accept writes. Note that as a performance optimization, the journal system
 * does not apply journal entries to state machines while in primary mode. Instead, the state
 * machine states must be directly modified by RPC handlers.
 *
 * The journal system may also be changed from primary to secondary mode. This transition is done by
 * resetting all state machines and re-building them by catching up on the journal.
 *
 * Example usage:
 *
 * <pre>
 * JournalSystem journalSystem = new JournalSystemImpl();
 * if (!journalSystem.isFormatted()) {
 *   journalSystem.format();
 * }
 * Journal blockMasterJournal = journalSystem.createJournal(blockMaster);
 * Journal fileSystemMasterJournal = journalSystem.createJournal(fileSystemMaster);
 *
 * // The journal system always starts in secondary mode. It must be transitioned to primary mode
 * // before it can write entries.
 * journalSystem.start();
 * journalSystem.setPrimary(true);
 *
 * try (JournalContext c = blockMasterJournal.createJournalContext()) {
 *   c.append(exampleBlockJournalEntry);
 * }
 * // At this point, the journal entry is persistently committed to the journal and will be applied
 * // asynchronously to the in-memory state of all secondary masters.
 * try (JournalContext c = fileSystemMasterJournal.createJournalContext()) {
 *   c.append(exampleFileSystemJournalEntry);
 * }
 * // Transition to a secondary journal. In this mode, the journal will apply entries to the masters
 * // as they are committed to the log.
 * journalSystem.setPrimary(false);
 * </pre>
