/**
 * Worker process and utils for working with the worker remotely.
 *
 * Main entry point for the worker is {@link alluxio.worker.AlluxioWorker#main}
 * which gets started by the alluxio start scripts. The {@link alluxio.worker.WorkerProcess}
 * spins up the different RPC services (thrift, data) which are mostly wrappers around
 * {@link alluxio.worker.block.BlockWorker}.
 *
 * <h1>Services</h1>
 *
 * <h2>DataServer</h2>
 *
 * This service is the main interaction between users and worker for reading and writing blocks.
 * The {@link alluxio.worker.DataServer} interface defines how to start/stop, and get port details;
 * to start, object init is used. The implementation of this interface is in
 * {@link alluxio.worker.grpc.GrpcDataServer}. It creates an {@link alluxio.worker.DataServer}
 * instance based on Netty which is an asynchronous event-driven network application framework.
 *
 * Data server handles the following types of block requests:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Read blocks in worker storage from network</li>
 *   <li>Read blocks in worker storage from local file system:
 *     short-circuit read for local client</li>
 *   <li>Read blocks in UFS</li>
 *   <li>Write blocks in worker storage from network</li>
 *   <li>Write blocks in worker storage from local file system:
 *     short-circuit write for local client</li>
 *   <li>Write blocks in UFS</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * The current protocol is described in {@link alluxio.proto.dataserver.Protocol}.
 * All the requests are generated by Protobuf to keep the protocol extensible but also
 * backward-compatible.
 *
 * <h2>Thrift</h2>
 *
 * The thrift service on worker side has been deprecated since v1.5. It used to serve
 * metadata operations (with a few operations that effect the worker's cached memory) such as lock
 * unlock, access, request space for blocks. It has been completely replaced by
 * the {@link alluxio.worker.DataServer} service.
