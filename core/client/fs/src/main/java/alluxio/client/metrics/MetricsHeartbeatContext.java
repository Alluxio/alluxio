/**
 * A class used to track metrics heartbeats to a master.
 *
 * The class should be instantiated when a new FileSystemContext is created with a
 * configuration that points to a given master. As new FileSystemContexts are created, if they
 * utilize the same connection details, then they can simply be added to this context so
 * that their information is included in the metrics heartbeat. To add them, one should simply
 * call {@link #addHeartbeat(ClientContext, MasterInquireClient)} with the necessary arguments.
 *
 * For each separate set of connection details, a new instance of this class is created. As
 * FileSystemContexts are closed, they remove themselves from the internal metrics heartbeat.
 * When a context reaches 0 tracked contexts it will automatically close and remove itself from
 * the internal MASTER_METRICS_HEARTBEAT map.
 *
 * When the final FileSystemContext closes and removes its heartbeat from metrics it will also
 * shutdown and close the executor service until a new {@link alluxio.client.file.FileSystemContext}
 * is created.
