/**
 * This class can be used for controlling heartbeat execution of a thread.
 *
 * In particular, the {@link #await(String)} method can be used to wait for a thread to start
 * waiting to be scheduled and the {@link #schedule(String)} method can be used to schedule a thread
 * that is waiting to be scheduled.
 *
 * The contract of this class is that the {@link #schedule(String)} method should only be called for
 * threads that are in fact waiting to be scheduled. If this contract is not met, concurrent
 * execution of a thread and the heartbeat scheduler logic to schedule the thread can lead to a
 * deadlock.
 *
 * For an example of how to use the {@link HeartbeatScheduler}, see unit test of
 * {@link HeartbeatThread}.
