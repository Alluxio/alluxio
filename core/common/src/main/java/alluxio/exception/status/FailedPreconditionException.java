/**
 * Exception indicating that operation was rejected because the system is not in a state required
 * for the operation's execution. For example, directory to be deleted may be non-empty, an rmdir
 * operation is applied to a non-directory, etc.
 *
 * A litmus test that may help a service implementor in deciding between
 * FailedPreconditionException, AbortedException, and UnavailableException:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   (a) Use UnavailableException if the client can retry just the failing call.
 *   (b) Use AbortedException if the client should retry at a higher-level (e.g., restarting a
 *       read-modify-write sequence).
 *   (c) Use FailedPreconditionException if the client should not retry until the system state has
 *       been explicitly fixed. E.g., if an "rmdir" fails because the directory is non-empty,
 *       FailedPreconditionException should be thrown since the client should not retry unless they
 *       have first fixed up the directory by deleting files from it.
 *   (d) Use FailedPreconditionException if the client performs conditional REST Get/Update/Delete
 *       on a resource and the resource on the server does not match the condition. E.g.,
 *       conflicting read-modify-write on the same resource.
 * </pre>
