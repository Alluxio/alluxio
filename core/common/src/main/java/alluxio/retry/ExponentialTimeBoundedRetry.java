/**
 * A retry policy which uses exponential backoff and a maximum duration time bound.
 *
 * A final retry will be performed at the time bound before giving up.
 *
 * For example, with initial sleep 10ms, maximum sleep 100ms, and maximum duration 500ms, the sleep
 * timings would be [10, 20, 40, 80, 100, 100, 100, 50], assuming the operation being retries takes
 * no time. The 50 at the end is because the previous times add up to 450, so the mechanism sleeps
 * for only 50ms before the final attempt.
 *
 * However, those are just the base sleep timings. For each sleep time, we multiply by a random
 * number from 1 to 1.1 to add jitter to avoid hotspotting.
