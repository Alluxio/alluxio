/**
 * An {@link ExecutorService} for running {@link ForkJoinTask}s. A {@code ForkJoinPool} provides the
 * entry point for submissions from non-{@code ForkJoinTask} clients, as well as management and
 * monitoring operations.
 *
 * <p>
 * A {@code ForkJoinPool} differs from other kinds of {@link ExecutorService} mainly by virtue of
 * employing <em>work-stealing</em>: all threads in the pool attempt to find and execute tasks
 * submitted to the pool and/or created by other active tasks (eventually blocking waiting for work
 * if none exist). This enables efficient processing when most tasks spawn other subtasks (as do
 * most {@code ForkJoinTask}s), as well as when many small tasks are submitted to the pool from
 * external clients. Especially when setting <em>asyncMode</em> to true in constructors, {@code
 * ForkJoinPool}s may also be appropriate for use with event-style tasks that are never joined. All
 * worker threads are initialized with {@link Thread#isDaemon} set {@code true}.
 *
 * <p>
 * A static {@link #commonPool()} is available and appropriate for most applications. The common
 * pool is used by any ForkJoinTask that is not explicitly submitted to a specified pool. Using the
 * common pool normally reduces resource usage (its threads are slowly reclaimed during periods of
 * non-use, and reinstated upon subsequent use).
 *
 * <p>
 * For applications that require separate or custom pools, a {@code
 * ForkJoinPool} may be constructed with a given target parallelism level; by default, equal to the
 * number of available processors. The pool attempts to maintain enough active (or available)
 * threads by dynamically adding, suspending, or resuming internal worker threads, even if some
 * tasks are stalled waiting to join others. However, no such adjustments are guaranteed in the face
 * of blocked I/O or other unmanaged synchronization. The nested {@link ManagedBlocker} interface
 * enables extension of the kinds of synchronization accommodated. The default policies may be
 * overridden using a constructor with parameters corresponding to those documented in class
 * {@link ThreadPoolExecutor}.
 *
 * <p>
 * In addition to execution and lifecycle control methods, this class provides status check methods
 * (for example {@link #getStealCount}) that are intended to aid in developing, tuning, and
 * monitoring fork/join applications. Also, method {@link #toString} returns indications of pool
 * state in a convenient form for informal monitoring.
 *
 * <p>
 * As is the case with other ExecutorServices, there are three main task execution methods
 * summarized in the following table. These are designed to be used primarily by clients not already
 * engaged in fork/join computations in the current pool. The main forms of these methods accept
 * instances of {@code ForkJoinTask}, but overloaded forms also allow mixed execution of plain
 * {@code
 * Runnable}- or {@code Callable}- based activities as well. However, tasks that are already
 * executing in a pool should normally instead use the within-computation forms listed in the table
 * unless using async event-style tasks that are not usually joined, in which case there is little
 * difference among choice of methods.

 * </ul>
 * If no thread factory is supplied via a system property, then the common pool uses a factory that
 * uses the system class loader as the {@linkplain Thread#getContextClassLoader() thread context
 * class loader}. In addition, if a {@link SecurityManager} is present, then the common pool uses a
 * factory supplying threads that have no {@link Permissions} enabled.
 *
 * Upon any error in establishing these settings, default parameters are used. It is possible to

  /*
   * Implementation Overview
   *
   * This class and its nested classes provide the main functionality and control for a set of
   * worker threads: Submissions from non-FJ threads enter into submission queues. Workers take
   * these tasks and typically split them into subtasks that may be stolen by other workers.
   * Preference rules give first priority to processing tasks from their own queues (LIFO or FIFO,
   * depending on mode), then to randomized FIFO steals of tasks in other queues. This framework
   * began as vehicle for supporting tree-structured parallelism using work-stealing. Over time, its
   * scalability advantages led to extensions and changes to better support more diverse usage
   * contexts. Because most internal methods and nested classes are interrelated, their main
   * rationale and descriptions are presented here; individual methods and nested classes contain
   * only brief comments about details.
   *
   * WorkQueues ==========
   *
   * Most operations occur within work-stealing queues (in nested class WorkQueue). These are
   * special forms of Deques that support only three of the four possible end-operations -- push,
   * pop, and poll (aka steal), under the further constraints that push and pop are called only from
   * the owning thread (or, as extended here, under a lock), while poll may be called from other
   * threads. (If you are unfamiliar with them, you probably want to read Herlihy and Shavit's book
   * "The Art of Multiprocessor programming", chapter 16 describing these in more detail before
   * proceeding.) The main work-stealing queue design is roughly similar to those in the papers
   * "Dynamic Circular Work-Stealing Deque" by Chase and Lev, SPAA 2005
   * (http://research.sun.com/scalable/pubs/index.html) and "Idempotent work stealing" by Michael,
   * Saraswat, and Vechev, PPoPP 2009 (http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1504186). The main
   * differences ultimately stem from GC requirements that we null out taken slots as soon as we
   * can, to maintain as small a footprint as possible even in programs generating huge numbers of
   * tasks. To accomplish this, we shift the CAS arbitrating pop vs poll (steal) from being on the
   * indices ("base" and "top") to the slots themselves.
   *
   * Adding tasks then takes the form of a classic array push(task) in a circular buffer:
   * q.array[q.top++ % length] = task;
   *
   * (The actual code needs to null-check and size-check the array, uses masking, not mod, for
   * indexing a power-of-two-sized array, properly fences accesses, and possibly signals waiting
   * workers to start scanning -- see below.) Both a successful pop and poll mainly entail a CAS of
   * a slot from non-null to null.
   *
   * The pop operation (always performed by owner) is: if ((the task at top slot is not null) and
   * (CAS slot to null)) decrement top and return task;
   *
   * And the poll operation (usually by a stealer) is if ((the task at base slot is not null) and
   * (CAS slot to null)) increment base and return task;
   *
   * There are several variants of each of these. In particular, almost all uses of poll occur
   * within scan operations that also interleave contention tracking (with associated code sprawl.)
   *
   * Memory ordering. See "Correct and Efficient Work-Stealing for Weak Memory Models" by Le, Pop,
   * Cohen, and Nardelli, PPoPP 2013 (http://www.di.ens.fr/~zappa/readings/ppopp13.pdf) for an
   * analysis of memory ordering requirements in work-stealing algorithms similar to (but different
   * than) the one used here. Extracting tasks in array slots via (fully fenced) CAS provides
   * primary synchronization. The base and top indices imprecisely guide where to extract from. We
   * do not always require strict orderings of array and index updates, so sometimes let them be
   * subject to compiler and processor reorderings. However, the volatile "base" index also serves
   * as a basis for memory ordering: Slot accesses are preceded by a read of base, ensuring
   * happens-before ordering with respect to stealers (so the slots themselves can be read via plain
   * array reads.) The only other memory orderings relied on are maintained in the course of
   * signalling and activation (see below). A check that base == top indicates (momentary)
   * emptiness, but otherwise may err on the side of possibly making the queue appear nonempty when
   * a push, pop, or poll have not fully committed, or making it appear empty when an update of top
   * has not yet been visibly written. (Method isEmpty() checks the case of a partially completed
   * removal of the last element.) Because of this, the poll operation, considered individually, is
   * not wait-free. One thief cannot successfully continue until another in-progress one (or, if
   * previously empty, a push) visibly completes. However, in the aggregate, we ensure at least
   * probabilistic non-blockingness. If an attempted steal fails, a scanning thief chooses a
   * different random victim target to try next. So, in order for one thief to progress, it suffices
   * for any in-progress poll or new push on any empty queue to complete.
   *
   * This approach also enables support of a user mode in which local task processing is in FIFO,
   * not LIFO order, simply by using poll rather than pop. This can be useful in message-passing
   * frameworks in which tasks are never joined.
   *
   * WorkQueues are also used in a similar way for tasks submitted to the pool. We cannot mix these
   * tasks in the same queues used by workers. Instead, we randomly associate submission queues with
   * submitting threads, using a form of hashing. The ThreadLocalRandom probe value serves as a hash
   * code for choosing existing queues, and may be randomly repositioned upon contention with other
   * submitters. In essence, submitters act like workers except that they are restricted to
   * executing local tasks that they submitted. Insertion of tasks in shared mode requires a lock
   * but we use only a simple spinlock (using field phase), because submitters encountering a busy
   * queue move to a different position to use or create other queues -- they block only when
   * creating and registering new queues. Because it is used only as a spinlock, unlocking requires
   * only a "releasing" store (using putOrderedInt).
   *
   * Management ==========
   *
   * The main throughput advantages of work-stealing stem from decentralized control -- workers
   * mostly take tasks from themselves or each other, at rates that can exceed a billion per second.
   * The pool itself creates, activates (enables scanning for and running tasks), deactivates,
   * blocks, and terminates threads, all with minimal central information. There are only a few
   * properties that we can globally track or maintain, so we pack them into a small number of
   * variables, often maintaining atomicity without blocking or locking. Nearly all essentially
   * atomic control state is held in a few volatile variables that are by far most often read (not
   * written) as status and consistency checks. We pack as much information into them as we can.
   *
   * Field "ctl" contains 64 bits holding information needed to atomically decide to add, enqueue
   * (on an event queue), and dequeue (and release)-activate workers. To enable this packing, we
   * restrict maximum parallelism to (1<<15)-1 (which is far in excess of normal operating range) to
   * allow ids, counts, and their negations (used for thresholding) to fit into 16bit subfields.
   *
   * Field "mode" holds configuration parameters as well as lifetime status, atomically and
   * monotonically setting SHUTDOWN, STOP, and finally TERMINATED bits.
   *
   * Field "workQueues" holds references to WorkQueues. It is updated (only during worker creation
   * and termination) under lock (using field workerNamePrefix as lock), but is otherwise
   * concurrently readable, and accessed directly. We also ensure that uses of the array reference
   * itself never become too stale in case of resizing. To simplify index-based operations, the
   * array size is always a power of two, and all readers must tolerate null slots. Worker queues
   * are at odd indices. Shared (submission) queues are at even indices, up to a maximum of 64
   * slots, to limit growth even if array needs to expand to add more workers. Grouping them
   * together in this way simplifies and speeds up task scanning.
   *
   * All worker thread creation is on-demand, triggered by task submissions, replacement of
   * terminated workers, and/or compensation for blocked workers. However, all other support code is
   * set up to work with other policies. To ensure that we do not hold on to worker references that
   * would prevent GC, all accesses to workQueues are via indices into the workQueues array (which
   * is one source of some of the messy code constructions here). In essence, the workQueues array
   * serves as a weak reference mechanism. Thus for example the stack top subfield of ctl stores
   * indices, not references.
   *
   * Queuing Idle Workers. Unlike HPC work-stealing frameworks, we cannot let workers spin
   * indefinitely scanning for tasks when none can be found immediately, and we cannot start/resume
   * workers unless there appear to be tasks available. On the other hand, we must quickly prod them
   * into action when new tasks are submitted or generated. In many usages, ramp-up time is the main
   * limiting factor in overall performance, which is compounded at program start-up by JIT
   * compilation and allocation. So we streamline this as much as possible.
   *
   * The "ctl" field atomically maintains total worker and "released" worker counts, plus the head
   * of the available worker queue (actually stack, represented by the lower 32bit subfield of ctl).
   * Released workers are those known to be scanning for and/or running tasks. Unreleased
   * ("available") workers are recorded in the ctl stack. These workers are made available for
   * signalling by enqueuing in ctl (see method runWorker). The "queue" is a form of Treiber stack.
   * This is ideal for activating threads in most-recently used order, and improves performance and
   * locality, outweighing the disadvantages of being prone to contention and inability to release a
   * worker unless it is topmost on stack. To avoid missed signal problems inherent in any
   * wait/signal design, available workers rescan for (and if found run) tasks after enqueuing.
   * Normally their release status will be updated while doing so, but the released worker ctl count
   * may underestimate the number of active threads. (However, it is still possible to determine
   * quiescence via a validation traversal -- see isQuiescent). After an unsuccessful rescan,
   * available workers are blocked until signalled (see signalWork). The top stack state holds the
   * value of the "phase" field of the worker: its index and status, plus a version counter that, in
   * addition to the count subfields (also serving as version stamps) provide protection against
   * Treiber stack ABA effects.
   *
   * Creating workers. To create a worker, we pre-increment counts (serving as a reservation), and
   * attempt to construct a ForkJoinWorkerThread via its factory. Upon construction, the new thread
   * invokes registerWorker, where it constructs a WorkQueue and is assigned an index in the
   * workQueues array (expanding the array if necessary). The thread is then started. Upon any
   * exception across these steps, or null return from factory, deregisterWorker adjusts counts and
   * records accordingly. If a null return, the pool continues running with fewer than the target
   * number workers. If exceptional, the exception is propagated, generally to some external caller.
   * Worker index assignment avoids the bias in scanning that would occur if entries were
   * sequentially packed starting at the front of the workQueues array. We treat the array as a
   * simple power-of-two hash table, expanding as needed. The seedIndex increment ensures no
   * collisions until a resize is needed or a worker is deregistered and replaced, and thereafter
   * keeps probability of collision low. We cannot use ThreadLocalRandom.getProbe() for similar
   * purposes here because the thread has not started yet, but do so for creating submission queues
   * for existing external threads (see externalPush).
   *
   * WorkQueue field "phase" is used by both workers and the pool to manage and track whether a
   * worker is UNSIGNALLED (possibly blocked waiting for a signal). When a worker is enqueued its
   * phase field is set. Note that phase field updates lag queue CAS releases so usage requires care
   * -- seeing a negative phase does not guarantee that the worker is available. When queued, the
   * lower 16 bits of scanState must hold its pool index. So we place the index there upon
   * initialization (see registerWorker) and otherwise keep it there or restore it when necessary.
   *
   * The ctl field also serves as the basis for memory synchronization surrounding activation. This
   * uses a more efficient version of a Dekker-like rule that task producers and consumers sync with
   * each other by both writing/CASing ctl (even if to its current value). This would be extremely
   * costly. So we relax it in several ways: (1) Producers only signal when their queue is empty.
   * Other workers propagate this signal (in method scan) when they find tasks; to further reduce
   * flailing, each worker signals only one other per activation. (2) Workers only enqueue after
   * scanning (see below) and not finding any tasks. (3) Rather than CASing ctl to its current value
   * in the common case where no action is required, we reduce write contention by equivalently
   * prefacing signalWork when called by an external task producer using a memory access with
   * full-volatile semantics or a "fullFence".
   *
   * Almost always, too many signals are issued. A task producer cannot in general tell if some
   * existing worker is in the midst of finishing one task (or already scanning) and ready to take
   * another without being signalled. So the producer might instead activate a different worker that
   * does not find any work, and then inactivates. This scarcely matters in steady-state
   * computations involving all workers, but can create contention and bookkeeping bottlenecks
   * during ramp-up, ramp-down, and small computations involving only a few workers.
   *
   * Scanning. Method runWorker performs top-level scanning for tasks. Each scan traverses and tries
   * to poll from each queue starting at a random index and circularly stepping. Scans are not
   * performed in ideal random permutation order, to reduce cacheline contention. The pseudorandom
   * generator need not have high-quality statistical properties in the long term, but just within
   * computations; We use Marsaglia XorShifts (often via ThreadLocalRandom.nextSecondarySeed), which
   * are cheap and suffice. Scanning also employs contention reduction: When scanning workers fail
   * to extract an apparently existing task, they soon restart at a different pseudorandom index.
   * This improves throughput when many threads are trying to take tasks from few queues, which can
   * be common in some usages. Scans do not otherwise explicitly take into account core affinities,
   * loads, cache localities, etc, However, they do exploit temporal locality (which usually
   * approximates these) by preferring to re-poll (at most #workers times) from the same queue after
   * a successful poll before trying others.
   *
   * Trimming workers. To release resources after periods of lack of use, a worker starting to wait
   * when the pool is quiescent will time out and terminate (see method scan) if the pool has
   * remained quiescent for period given by field keepAlive.
   *
   * Shutdown and Termination. A call to shutdownNow invokes tryTerminate to atomically set a
   * runState bit. The calling thread, as well as every other worker thereafter terminating, helps
   * terminate others by cancelling their unprocessed tasks, and waking them up, doing so repeatedly
   * until stable. Calls to non-abrupt shutdown() preface this by checking whether termination
   * should commence by sweeping through queues (until stable) to ensure lack of in-flight
   * submissions and workers about to process them before triggering the "STOP" phase of
   * termination.
   *
   * Joining Tasks =============
   *
   * Any of several actions may be taken when one worker is waiting to join a task stolen (or always
   * held) by another. Because we are multiplexing many tasks on to a pool of workers, we can't
   * always just let them block (as in Thread.join). We also cannot just reassign the joiner's
   * run-time stack with another and replace it later, which would be a form of "continuation", that
   * even if possible is not necessarily a good idea since we may need both an unblocked task and
   * its continuation to progress. Instead we combine two tactics:
   *
   * Helping: Arranging for the joiner to execute some task that it would be running if the steal
   * had not occurred.
   *
   * Compensating: Unless there are already enough live threads, method tryCompensate() may create
   * or re-activate a spare thread to compensate for blocked joiners until they unblock.
   *
   * A third form (implemented in tryRemoveAndExec) amounts to helping a hypothetical compensator:
   * If we can readily tell that a possible action of a compensator is to steal and execute the task
   * being joined, the joining thread can do so directly, without the need for a compensation
   * thread.
   *
   * The ManagedBlocker extension API can't use helping so relies only on compensation in method
   * awaitBlocker.
   *
   * The algorithm in awaitJoin entails a form of "linear helping". Each worker records (in field
   * source) the id of the queue from which it last stole a task. The scan in method awaitJoin uses
   * these markers to try to find a worker to help (i.e., steal back a task from and execute it)
   * that could hasten completion of the actively joined task. Thus, the joiner executes a task that
   * would be on its own local deque if the to-be-joined task had not been stolen. This is a
   * conservative variant of the approach described in Wagner & Calder "Leapfrogging: a portable
   * technique for implementing efficient futures" SIGPLAN Notices, 1993
   * (http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=155354). It differs mainly in that we only record queue
   * ids, not full dependency links. This requires a linear scan of the workQueues array to locate
   * stealers, but isolates cost to when it is needed, rather than adding to per-task overhead.
   * Searches can fail to locate stealers GC stalls and the like delay recording sources. Further,
   * even when accurately identified, stealers might not ever produce a task that the joiner can in
   * turn help with. So, compensation is tried upon failure to find tasks to run.
   *
   * Compensation does not by default aim to keep exactly the target parallelism number of unblocked
   * threads running at any given time. Some previous versions of this class employed immediate
   * compensations for any blocked join. However, in practice, the vast majority of blockages are
   * transient byproducts of GC and other JVM or OS activities that are made worse by replacement.
   * Rather than impose arbitrary policies, we allow users to override the default of only adding
   * threads upon apparent starvation. The compensation mechanism may also be bounded. Bounds for
   * the commonPool (see COMMON_MAX_SPARES) better enable JVMs to cope with programming errors and
   * abuse before running out of resources to do so.
   *
   * Common Pool ===========
   *
   * The static common pool always exists after static initialization. Since it (or any other
   * created pool) need never be used, we minimize initial construction overhead and footprint to
   * the setup of about a dozen fields.
   *
   * When external threads submit to the common pool, they can perform subtask processing (see
   * externalHelpComplete and related methods) upon joins. This caller-helps policy makes it
   * sensible to set common pool parallelism level to one (or more) less than the total number of
   * available cores, or even zero for pure caller-runs. We do not need to record whether external
   * submissions are to the common pool -- if not, external help methods return quickly. These
   * submitters would otherwise be blocked waiting for completion, so the extra effort (with
   * liberally sprinkled task status checks) in inapplicable cases amounts to an odd form of limited
   * spin-wait before blocking in ForkJoinTask.join.
   *
   * As a more appropriate default in managed environments, unless overridden by system properties,
   * we use workers of subclass InnocuousForkJoinWorkerThread when there is a SecurityManager
   * present. These workers have no permissions set, do not belong to any user-defined ThreadGroup,
   * and erase all ThreadLocals after executing any top-level task (see
   * WorkQueue.afterTopLevelExec). The associated mechanics (mainly in ForkJoinWorkerThread) may be
   * JVM-dependent and must access particular Thread class fields to achieve this effect.
   *
   * Style notes ===========
   *
   * Memory ordering relies mainly on Unsafe intrinsics that carry the further responsibility of
   * explicitly performing null- and bounds- checks otherwise carried out implicitly by JVMs. This
   * can be awkward and ugly, but also reflects the need to control outcomes across the unusual
   * cases that arise in very racy code with very few invariants. All fields are read into locals
   * before use, and null-checked if they are references. This is usually done in a "C"-like style
   * of listing declarations at the heads of methods or blocks, and using inline assignments on
   * first encounter. Nearly all explicit checks lead to bypass/return, not exception throws,
   * because they may legitimately arise due to cancellation/revocation during shutdown.
   *
   * There is a lot of representation-level coupling among classes ForkJoinPool,
   * ForkJoinWorkerThread, and ForkJoinTask. The fields of WorkQueue maintain data structures
   * managed by ForkJoinPool, so are directly accessed. There is little point trying to reduce this,
   * since any associated future changes in representations will need to be accompanied by
   * algorithmic changes anyway. Several methods intrinsically sprawl because they must accumulate
   * sets of consistent reads of fields held in local variables. There are also other coding
   * oddities (including several unnecessary-looking hoisted null checks) that help some methods
   * perform reasonably even when interpreted (not compiled).
   *
   * The order of declarations in this file is (with a few exceptions): (1) Static utility functions
   * (2) Nested (static) classes (3) Static fields (4) Fields, along with constants used when
   * unpacking some of them (5) Internal control methods (6) Callbacks and other support for
   * ForkJoinTask methods (7) Exported methods (8) Static block initializing statics in minimally
   * dependent order

   *

   *        {@code true}, then no exception is thrown, so the pool continues to operate with fewer

   *        later replaced if needed). For the default value, use {@code 60, TimeUnit.SECONDS}.

   * Returns a cheap heuristic guide for task partitioning when programmers, frameworks, tools, or

   * we ask users only about tradeoffs in overhead vs expected throughput and its variance, rather
   * than how finely to partition tasks.
   *
   * In a steady state strict (tree-structured) computation, each thread makes available for
   * stealing enough tasks for other threads to remain active. Inductively, if all threads play by
   * the same rules, each thread should make available only a constant number of tasks.
   *
   * The minimum useful constant is just 1. But using a value of 1 would require immediate
   * replenishment upon each steal to maintain enough tasks, which is infeasible. Further,
   * partitionings/granularities of offered tasks should minimize steal rates, which in general
   * means that threads nearer the top of computation tree should generate more than those nearer
   * the bottom. In perfect steady state, each thread is at approximately the same level of
   * computation tree. However, producing extra tasks amortizes the uncertainty of progress and
   * diffusion assumptions.
   *
   * So, users will want to use values larger (but not much larger) than 1 to both smooth over
   * transient shortages and hedge against uneven progress; as traded off against the cost of extra
   * task overhead. We leave the user to pick a threshold value to compare with the results of this
   * call to guide decisions, but recommend values such as 3.
   *
   * When all threads are active, it is on average OK to estimate surplus strictly locally. In
   * steady-state, if one thread is maintaining say 2 surplus tasks, then so are others. So we can
   * just use estimated queue length. However, this strategy alone leads to serious mis-estimates in
   * some non-steady-state conditions (ramp-up, ramp-down, other stalls). We can detect many of
   * these by further considering the number of "idle" threads, that are known to have zero queued
   * tasks, so compensate by a factor of (#idle/#active) threads.
