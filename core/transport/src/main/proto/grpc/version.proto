  // 1. PollingMasterInquireClient uses this endpoint to tell who is the primary master.
  // 2. AbstractClient uses this endpoint to verify the version before it RPCs with the master.

  // Behaviors:
  // 1. old clients -> new cluster standby masters
  // PollingMasterInquireClient does not set this field and is able to tell which one is primary master because
  // the request will be rejected on the standby master.
  // AbstractClient does not set this field.
  // Old clients only connects to primary so this doesn't break the existing behavior.
  //
  // 2. new clients -> new cluster standby masters
  // PollingMasterInquireClient does not set this field and is able to tell which one is primary master because
  // the request will be rejected on the standby master.
  // AbstractClient sets this field to true. Rpcs to standby masters can go through and pass the version verification.
