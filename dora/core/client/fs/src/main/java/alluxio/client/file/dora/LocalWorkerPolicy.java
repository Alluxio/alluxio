/**
 * A policy where a client will ONLY talk to a local worker.
 *
 * This policy can probably only be used in testing. If client on node A reads path /a,
 * it will only talk to the worker on node A and produce a cache there. If a client on
 * node B reads the same path /a, it will not see the cache on node A.
 *
 * A use case for this policy is a test like StressWorkerBench, where we create clients
 * (with job service) and simulate I/O workload to workers.
 * If all clients talk to their local worker, the test creates balanced stress on each worker
 * and we measure local read performance.
