 * Interface for determining the Alluxio worker location to serve a read or write request.

 * A policy MUST have the property of being deterministic, because distributed clients must
 * be able to resolve the same path to the same worker(s) for the file.
 * Imagine a totally random policy which resolves a path to a random worker in the cluster.
 * The first reader of path /a will resolve to a random worker in the cluster and leave a cache
 * there. A subsequent reader will resolve to another random worker and the chance of a cache-hit
 * is very low! Worse still, that subsequent reader may produce another cache replica.
 * This random policy wastes cache space and provides terrible cache hit rate.
