/**
 * Respond to the kill command when in mount fuse JVM.
 * If it does not respond, the subsequent shutdown hook will not be triggered.
 *
 * Fuse will have its own signal handler installed as part of fuse_main_real
 * with fuse_set_signal_handlers for SIGHUP/SIGINT/SIGTERM, but it will not replace
 * any existing signal handlers installed up front. Since jvm always install
 * signal handlers therefore libfuse is never able to do so.
 * But disabling JVM's signal handlers by flag -Xrs, fuse acts differently
 * on receiving these signals on different platform(MacOs can receive/Linux can't)
 * Therefore we always let 'umount' or 'fusermount' to instruct libfuse
 * to stop serving, only when it won't respond, we rely on this SignalHandler to
 * act on these signals to shutdown ourselves.
