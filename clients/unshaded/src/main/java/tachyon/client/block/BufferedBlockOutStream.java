/**
 * Provides a stream API to write a block to Tachyon. An instance of this class can be obtained by
 * calling {@link TachyonBlockStore#getOutStream}. Only one BlockOutStream should be opened for a
 * block. This class is not thread safe and should only be used by one thread.
 *
 * <p>
 * The type of BlockOutStream returned will depend on the user configuration and cluster setup. A
 * {@link LocalBlockOutStream} is returned if the client is co-located with a Tachyon worker and the
 * user has enabled this optimization. Otherwise, a {@link RemoteBlockOutStream} will be returned
 * which will write the data through a Tachyon worker.
