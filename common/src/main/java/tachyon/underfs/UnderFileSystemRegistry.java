/**
 * <p>
 * Central registry of available {@link UnderFileSystemFactory} instances that uses the
 * {@link ServiceLoader} mechanism to automatically discover available factories and provides a
 * central place for obtaining actual {@link UnderFileSystem} instances.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Registering New Factories</h3>
 * <p>
 * New factories can be registered either using the {@linkplain ServiceLoader} based automatic
 * discovery mechanism or manually using the static {@link #register(UnderFileSystemFactory)}
 * method. The down-side of the automatic discovery mechanism is that the discovery order is not
 * controllable so if your implementation is designed as a replacement for one of the standard
 * implementations depending on the order in which the JVM discovers the services your own
 * implementation may not take priority. You can enable {@code DEBUG} level logging for this class
 * to see the order in which factories are discovered and which is selected when obtaining a
 * {@link UnderFileSystem} instance for a path. If this shows that your implementation is not
 * getting discovered or used then you may wish to use the manual registration approach.
 * <p/>
 * <h4>Automatic Discovery</h4>
 * <p>
 * To use the {@linkplain ServiceLoader} based mechanism you need to have a file named
 * {@code tachyon.underfs.UnderFileSystemFactory} placed in the {@code META-INF\services} directory
 * of your project. This file should contain the full name of your factory types (one per line),
 * your factory types must have a public unparameterised constructor available (see
 * {@link ServiceLoader} for more detail on this). You can enable {@code DEBUG} level logging to see
 * factories as they are discovered if you wish to check that your implementation gets discovered.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that if you are bundling Tachyon plus your code in a shaded JAR using Maven make sure to use
 * the {@code ServicesResourceTransformer} as otherwise your services file will override the core
 * provided services file and leave the standard factories and under file system implementations
 * unavailable.
 * </p>
 * <h4>Manual Registration</h4>
 * <p>
 * To manually register a factory simply pass an instance of your factory to the
 * {@link #register(UnderFileSystemFactory)} method. This can be useful when your factory cannot be
 * instantiated without arguments or in cases where automatic discovery does not give your factory
 * priority. Factories registered this way will be registered at the start of the factories list so
 * will have the first opportunity to indicate whether they support a requested path.
 * </p>
