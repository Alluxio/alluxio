# An Alluxio master will be started on each of the machines listed below.
#
# In HA mode, Alluxio will use Zookeeper to decide which of the masters should
# act as the primary. In non-HA mode, the master started on the host identified
# by the first entry in this file will act as the primary; the remaining hosts
# will be used to start a secondary; which are responsible for journal compaction.
#
# In either case, multi-master deployments require that the masters can all access
# the same journal through a shared medium (e.g. HDFS or NFS).
