   * be set by either the netty I/O thread or the packet reader thread. mError overrides mCancel
   * and mEof, mEof overrides mCancel.
   *
   * These notifications determine 3 ways to complete a read request.
   * 1. mEof: The read request is fulfilled. All the data requested by the client or all the data in
   *    the block/file has been read. The packet reader replies a SUCCESS response when processing
   *    mEof.
   * 2. mCancel: The read request is cancelled by the client. A cancel request is ignored if mEof
   *    is set. The packet reader replies a CANCEL response when processing mCancel.
   *    Note: The client can send a cancel request after the server has sent a SUCCESS response. But
   *    it is not possible for the client to send a CANCEL request after the channel has been
   *    released. So it is impossible for a CANCEL request from one read request to cancel
   *    another read request.
   * 3. mError: mError is set whenever an error occurs. It can be from an exception when reading
   *    packet, or writing packet to netty or the client closes the channel etc. An ERROR response
   *    is optionally sent to the client when packet reader thread process mError. The channel
   *    is closed after this error response is sent.
   *
   * Note: it is guaranteed that only one of SUCCESS and CANCEL responses is sent at most once
   * because the packet reader thread won't be restarted as long as mCancel or mEof is set except
   * when error happens (mError overrides mCancel and mEof).
