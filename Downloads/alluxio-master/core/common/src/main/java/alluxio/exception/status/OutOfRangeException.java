/**
 * Exception indicating that and operation was attempted past the valid range. E.g., seeking or
 * reading past end of file.
 *
 * Unlike InvalidArgumentException, this error indicates a problem that may be fixed if the system
 * state changes. For example, a 32-bit file system will generate InvalidArgumentException if asked
 * to read at an offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1], but it will generate
 * OutOfRangeException if asked to read from an offset past the current file size.
 *
 * There is a fair bit of overlap between FailedPreconditionException and OutOfRangeException. We
 * recommend using OutOfRangeException (the more specific error) when it applies so that callers who
 * are iterating through a space can easily look for an OutOfRangeException to detect when they are
 * done.
