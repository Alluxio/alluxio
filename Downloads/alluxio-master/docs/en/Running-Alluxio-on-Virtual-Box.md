Alluxio can be deployed on [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) on your local machine
using the [Vagrant scripts](https://github.com/alluxio/alluxio/tree/master/deploy/vagrant)
that come with Alluxio. The scripts let you create, configure, and destroy clusters that come
automatically configured with HDFS.

## Prerequisites

**Install VirtualBox**

Download [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

**Install Vagrant**

Download [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

**Install Alluxio**

[Clone Alluxio Repository](https://github.com/Alluxio/alluxio) to your local machine

**Install python library dependencies**

Install [python>=2.7](https://www.python.org/), not python3.

Under `deploy/vagrant` directory in your home directory, run:

```bash
$ sudo bash bin/install.sh
```

Alternatively, you can manually install [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/), and then
in `deploy/vagrant` run:

```bash
$ sudo pip install -r pip-req.txt
```

## Launch a Cluster

Now you can launch the Alluxio cluster with Hadoop2.4.1 as under filesystem by running the script
under `deploy/vagrant`:

```bash
$ ./create <number of machines> vb
```

Each node of the cluster runs an Alluxio worker, and the `AlluxioMaster` runs an Alluxio master.

## Access the cluster

**Access through Web UI**

After the command `./create <number of machines> vb` succeeds, you can see two green lines like
below shown at the end of the shell output:

```bash
>>> AlluxioMaster public IP is xxx, visit xxx:19999 for Alluxio web UI<<<
>>> visit default port of the web UI of what you deployed <<<
```

Default port for Alluxio Web UI is **19999**.

Default port for Hadoop Web UI is **50070**.

Visit `http://{MASTER_IP}:{PORT}` in the browser to access the Web UIs.

**Access with ssh**

The nodes set up are named as `AlluxioMaster`, `AlluxioWorker1`, `AlluxioWorker2` and so on.

To ssh into a node, run:

```bash
$ vagrant ssh <node name>
```

For example, you can ssh into `AlluxioMaster` with:

```bash
$ vagrant ssh AlluxioMaster
```

All software is installed under the root directory, e.g. Alluxio is installed in `/alluxio`,
and Hadoop is installed in `/hadoop`.

On the `AlluxioMaster` node, you can run tests against Alluxio to check its health:

```bash
$ /alluxio/bin/alluxio runTests
```

After the tests finish, visit Alluxio web UI at `http://{MASTER_IP}:19999` again. Click `Browse
File System` in the navigation bar, and you should see the files written to Alluxio by the above
tests.

From a node in the cluster, you can ssh to other nodes in the cluster without password with:

```bash
$ ssh AlluxioWorker1
```

## Destroy the cluster

Under `deploy/vagrant` directory, you can run:

```bash
$ ./destroy
```

to destroy the cluster that you created. Only one cluster can be created at a time. After the
command succeeds, the virtual machines are terminated.
